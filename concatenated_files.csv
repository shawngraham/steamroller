"1.txt","Aidonia is a village ten kilometres northwest of Nemea in the northeastern Peloponnesian district of Corinthia in Greece. In November 1976, a Mycenaean (fifteenth-century BC) cemetery was discovered not far from the village, and the tombs were dug out illegally by local archaiokapiloi (a term used for looters in Greece) . There were reports of a gun battle between rival gangs of archaiokapiloi, and evidence that local government officials had sanctioned and even participated in the plunder . Looted objects were rumoured to have been smuggled out of Greece hidden in watermelons . In November 1977, the Greek Archaeological Service assigned a guard to the site, and in Spring 1978 it commenced official excavations. Twenty chamber tombs were discovered, but only two had survived untouched. The remaining eighteen tombs had been largely emptied of their contents, though in one , the looters had overlooked a pit dug into the floor of the tomb. After excavation, it was found to contain an assemblage of gold jewelry . (Mycenaean chamber tombs typically contain several interments and may be richly furnished with pottery, metalwork and jewelry). Nothing much was heard outside Greece about the plundered Aidonia cemetery until April 1993, when New York’s Michael Ward Gallery offered on display for sale a collection comprising approximately fifty items of Mycenean gold jewelry and sealstones. A catalogue accompanying the display entitled Gold of the Mycenaeans, with an introduction and object descriptions by archaeologist John Betts, could only offer ‘a European collector’ for provenance. Potential customers were reassured by the catalogue, however, that gold analyses conducted by Jack Ogden of the Cambridge Centre for Precious Metal Research had guaranteed the authenticity of the material, and that in reply to a written enquiry the Greek Ministry of Culture had confirmed that the material was not stolen . The asking price for the assemblage was US$1.5 million . On 4 April 1993, the display was trailed in the New York Times, where the objects were described as ‘rare gold baubles: small, ancient and radiant’ . Two days later, on 6 April, archaeologist Ricardo Elia alerted the Consul General of Greece in New York to the material on display . On 27 April 1993, archaeologist James Wright, who had worked at Nemea, informed the Greek Archaeological Service of his suspicion that the material might have been looted from Aidonia . After obtaining a copy of the catalogue, the Greek Ministry of Culture convened a committee of experts to investigate the possible origin of the material. The committee concluded that because of close stylistic and technical affinities between objects excavated legitimately at Aidonia and those offered for sale in New York, the New York material must have been looted from Aidonia. The Ministry of Culture also recognized that it had received a letter in 1992 from an Athenian lawyer asking for information about the objects, though not mentioning the name of Michael Ward. The Ministry had responded that while there was no evidence to show that the material had been illegally excavated or stolen from a museum, if any such evidence should become available then Greece reserved the right to ask for the material’s return . On 14 May 1993, attorneys acting on behalf of Greece notified Ward that the material was the property of Greece and asked for its return . On 25 May they obtained an injunction from the US District Court, Southern District of New York, preventing the sale or transport out the state of the material, and sued for its return . On 30 December 1993, an out-of-court settlement was announced whereby Ward undertook to donate the material to the US-based Society for the Preservation of the Greek Heritage (SPGH). By donating the material to the charitable SPGH instead of directly to Greece, Ward was able to claim a tax deduction for the purchase price of the material, said to be $150,000 . Because Ward was a dealer, he was limited to claiming the cost to himself of acquiring the material. If he had been a collector, he would have been able to claim its fair market value, thought by Ward to be $1.5 million . The SPGH returned the material to Greece in 1996 . The settlement between Greece and Ward was welcomed by some commentators, but there have also been expressions of regret that the case never proceeded to court. On the positive side, the settlement secured the return of what was most likely illicit material to Greece. Ward avoided the large financial loss that he would have incurred if the court had decided against his ownership. Both sides minimized their legal fees. By settling out-of-court, however, any information possessed by Ward about the material’s provenance remained a private matter. It is thought unlikely that the material offered by Ward and recovered by Greece represents the totality of the material looted from Aidonia. There was no pottery, for example. Without more information about provenance, there is little hope of locating and recovering the remainder . In the absence of reliable provenance, it has also been argued that the source of the recovered material is far from definite. The Aidonia provenience was established on the basis of stylistic and technical similarities, but while these similarities might suggest an area of common manufacture, they do not necessarily indicate a place of joint deposition. The objects acquired by Ward might possibly have been found elsewhere. If the case had gone to court, uncertainties surrounding the method used to establish source would probably have been exploited, and it is possible that they would have fatally undermined Greece’s case . These lingering doubts about source also make it potentially misleading to lump together the material obtained through legitimate excavation with that recovered from Ward as a singular ‘treasure’ . Again, if the provenance of the material had been resolved in a court of law, using evidence apart from that of the objects themselves, the status of the ‘treasure’ would have been made more secure, to the benefit of archaeological scholarship. Ward later claimed that Greece had concocted a provenance and that US archaeologists had embarrassed Greece into taking action . After the looting had ended, the residents of Aidonia fell to feuding amongst themselves, and the village was largely abandoned . New tombs are believed to have been robbed there in 2002 and 2004 . The Greek journalist Nikos Zirganos has compared what happened at Aidonia unfavourably to nearby Nemea, where finds from a long-term programme of archaeological excavation and research are curated in a purpose-built museum for the benefit of the general public ."
"10.txt","Fakes and reworked pieces (repainted, recarved, or altered in modern times in some other way) are a constant danger in the art and antiquities trade, often assisted in going unnoticed or unchallenged by the lack of provenance or provenience common across the market . Coptic Art, although appearing in collections of numerous museums such as the Metropolitan Museum in New York or the Louvre , has nonetheless been regarded as a genre of art with limited market demand compared to other types of art and antiquities. This observation has been used in the past by some observers to reject the possibility of there being many fakes, on the ground that it would not be sufficiently profitable to produce them – an assertion rejected by others . The term ‘Coptic Art’ refers to artistic material produced in Egypt from the 3rd to the 8th Centuries AD , with objects such as stone reliefs ‘made for use in pagan and Coptic Christian cemeteries as well as in Christian churches and monasteries’ . Hence, examples of Coptic Art can exhibit both Christian and pagan influences . In the aftermath of World War II, Coptic Art began to appear more frequently on the art and antiquities market, especially from the late 1950s to the 1970s . Many pieces were published (and hence seemingly authenticated) by specialists and acquired by museums . The majority of the examples appearing on the market – aside from around 1,000 pieces known from earlier archaeological excavations – seem to have come from a small number of dealers in New York and Switzerland , seemingly with no provenance information in most if not all cases . One of the museums to invest in a large number of Coptic artefacts in this period was the Brooklyn Museum in New York. This came to be regarded as one of the largest collections in the world and the second largest in the USA , until many of its pieces were uncovered as fakes . Currently one third of the current collection (ten out of thirty objects) is believed to be fake , with many more in the collection identified as verfälschte Stücke; faked works: ‘…in contradiction to absolute fakes… … [a] term for ancient but severely recarved and repainted pieces’ . The fakes are believed all to originate in the village of Sheikh Ibada in Egypt , possibly the work of just a handful of sculptors . Suggestions that all was not well with the emerging examples of Coptic Art that many collectors and museums had been buying up, now often referred to collectively as the ‘Sheikh Ibada group’, were first seen in print in 1963 when art historian John Beckwith expressed concern about the group’s authenticity . However, it was in 1977, when Gary Vikan drew attention to the possible nature of the suspect sculptures, albeit in an unpublished format , that a wider awareness of the presence of fakes came about. Interestingly, many of the confirmed forgeries deal with Christian themes, suggesting to some that this was a response to a market demand for Coptic material that favoured Christian imagery over pagan . As well as the Brooklyn Museum, many more museums are also affected. The Recklinghausen museum in Germany has been acknowledged to be the museum most affected by the problem of fake Coptic Art . Furthermore, it has been suggested that some forgeries may also be found within Egyptian museums, for example at the Coptic Museum . In 2009, the Brooklyn Museum displayed its Coptic Art collection, including the known fakes and reworked and repainted pieces, in a temporary exhibition titled “Unearthing the Truth: Egypt’s Pagan and Coptic Sculpture” , which as a key component of its theme highlighted in no uncertain terms which of artefacts were fake and which were not. This was heralded as an unusual move . Others have questioned the extent to which yet more examples in the museum’s collection may also be faked or reworked ."
"100.txt","San Andrés de Machaca, the largest village within the greater municipality of San Andrés de Machaca, is located in the Ingavi Province, 230 km from the city of La Paz in Bolivia’s Altiplano. According to the 2001 national census , the municipality had a total population of 6,299 people, 96 per cent of whom identified as being ethnically Aymara, and 87 per cent of whom spoke Aymara as their primary language. Nearly all inhabitants of the municipality were classified as living in poverty and 74 per cent were classified as living in extreme poverty . The municipality contains several archaeological sites, including chullpas or pre-Conquest funerary towers, and a stone church known as el Templo de San Andrés de Machaca or la Iglesia de San Andrés de Machaca. This remote Bolivian church has been robbed on several occasions; two paintings stolen from it were recovered in London in 2011. Construction of the church began in 1806 and it was completed in 1833. The building project was directed by an Indigenous architect named Fancisco Coillo . The church was designated a National Monument via Supreme Decree No 06137, signed on 15 June 1962 . Since being added to the National Monument list, the Templo de San Andrés de Machaca has been robbed numerous times, mostly during the past 15 years . The village of San Andrés de Machaca has historically been too poor to secure the church properly. Robberies The Church at San Andrés de Machaca, Bolivia via ERBOL On Christmas Eve 1997, the Templo de San Andrés de Machaca was looted . This was not the first time the church had been robbed, but details of previous robberies are unclear. More than 100 works of religious art were stolen on this occasion . Among these were several 17th and 18th century religious paintings . The church was robbed again in 2008 and forty-seven cultural objects were stolen . Father Valerio Pacheco, priest of the Templo de San Andrés de Machaca, discovered the theft on the morning of 14 August. Among other items, two paintings (‘San Francisco de Paula’ and ‘Santísima Trinidad’), six sculptures of saints, a tabernacle, and thirty pieces of embossed silver (including incense braziers, a crucifix, a crown, and a heart with seven swords) were taken . All of these items had been previously catalogued by the Bolivian Ministry of Cultures. A list bearing their measurements is housed on the website of the Secretary of Culture of Argentina, via Interpol. The church was robbed yet again in April 2010, but the thieves were caught within the week (see below). According to the Bolivian Ministry of Cultures, as of 2009 a total of 1,877 items have been stolen from the Templo de San Andrés de Machaca . Cultural Objects Recovered in El Alto, Bolivia In April 2010, three men were arrested in the Villa Remedios zone of El Alto, a sprawling satellite city on the high plain above La Paz. The city’s commander of police, Felix Segales, gave the names of those arrested as Mario Andrade Morales (it was later announced that this man was actually Edgar Quiroz Soliz), Felipe Perez Paco and Nicomedes Blanco Paco, all Bolivian nationals . The men were stopped by highway police on the road leading to the city of Oruro because of erratic driving and because the vehicle looked to be suspiciously filled with packages . Bolivia’s Fuerza Especial de Lucha Contra el Crimen (FELCC) recovered fifty-six cultural objects from the vehicle, all of which had been stolen from the Templo de San Andrés de Machaca . The pieces recovered included three 18th century religious paintings, two historic picture frames, a mirror, and twenty-six fragments of an altar decorated with gold leaf . Although it had been thought that these pieces were stolen in the 2008 church robbery, the objects recovered had not yet been reported stolen . A technical committee from the Ministry of Cultures visited the church and verified the theft, which they determined had occurred at some point during the same week as the arrests . Segales stated that the men arrested in El Alto planned to smuggle the objects into Peru . In October 2010, Felipe Pérez Paco and Édgar Quiroz Soliz were convicted of the theft of objects from the church at San Andres de Machaca and sentenced to four and a half years in prison . Proceedings against Nicómedes Blanco Paco were suspended temporarily , but was convicted of the crime several days later. Paintings Recovered in London In May 2011, a Washington-based art dealer consulted the Art Loss Register with questions about the provenance of two colonial period Bolivian paintings that he was handling for an American collector . These paintings were, according to some accounts, about to be consigned for auction in London . Researchers were able to positively identify the two paintings as portraits of Santa Rosa de Viterbo1 and San Agustín which had been stolen from San Andrés de Machaca during the 1997 robbery . On 12 September 2011, the paintings were returned to the Bolivian Embassy in London . After being restored, the paintings are to be returned to the Templo de San Andrés de Machaca . To help support this return, the mayor of the municipality, Macario Mamani Mamani, requested government funding for the restoration of the church . The final designs for this project were delivered to Mamani in March 2012. The plan aspires to promote cultural tourism development for the municipality . About the Missing Paintings The following paintings are still missing and photographs of them are available online via Interpol and the Art Loss Register : Archangel Arcabucero, 100 cm by 90 cm, oil on canvas Saint Rose of Lima, 165 cm by 110 cm, oil on canvas Saint Francis Protecting the Laics, 200 cm by 140 cm, oil on canvas The holy Family, 170 cm by 110 cm, oil on canvas The paintings were made by unnamed local artists. They were painted on reused canvas from European packing bales mounted on wooden racks . Lupe Meneses, the director of cataloguing with the Bolivian Ministry of Cultures, has emphasised the importance of these works, stating that they were developed by Indigenous people at a significant time in Bolivian history which allows for the possibility of different interpretations of the artwork ."
"101.txt","In 2008, two alabaster vessels in the form of trussed ducks were returned to Egypt (SCA ). They had been officially excavated in 1979 from a burial chamber in the pyramid complex of the 12th Dynasty pharaoh Amenemhat III at Dashur, and stolen from storage in Saqqara sometime later. In 2006, Christie’s New York brought one of the ducks to the attention of a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (who was ironically the artefact’s excavator). It was advertised as lot 171 in the Christie’s 16 June 2006 Antiquities catalogue, described as an Egyptian alabaster vessel, with an estimated price of $20,000–30,000 USD. The provenance was said to be an Israeli private collection, acquired prior to 1975. The Metropolitan’s curator alerted the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities. Christie’s withdrew the piece from sale, allowing US Customs and Immigration to obtain a seizure warrant prior to its return to Egypt. The identity of the consignor was not revealed. The second duck was recognized in the possession of London-based dealer Rupert Wace, who returned it to its previous owner in Paris, the auction company PIASA. PIASA then returned the piece to Egypt (SCA ). (Image via the Supreme Council of Antiquities and Rupert Wace Gallery)"
"102.txt","In 1993 a large, unprovenanced silver ‘treasure’ of Roman date was subject to a court battle over ownership in New York. The Sevso Treasure is a collection of Roman artefacts of unknown findspot and incomplete provenance. It comprises fourteen pieces of silver plate, together with a copper cauldron in which it is claimed the silver was found . The pieces are as follows: 1. Hunting (or Sevso) Plate. Diameter: 70.5 cm; weight: 8873 g. 2. Meleager Plate. Diameter: 69.4 cm; weight: 8606 g. 3. Achilles Plate. Diameter: 72 cm; 11,786 g. 4. Geometric Plate: Diameter: 64.2 cm; weight: 7150 g. 5. Amphora. Height: 38.5 cm; 2506 g. 6. Dionysiac Ewer. Height: 43.5 cm; weight 3000 g. 7. Animal Ewer. Height: 51 cm; weight: 3983 g. 8. Hippolytus Situla A. Height: 22.7 cm; weight: 4436 g. 9. Hippolytus Situla B. Height: 22.9 cm; weight: 4478 g. 10. Hippolytus Ewer. Height: 57.3 cm; weight: 4051 g. 11. Geometric Ewer A. Height: 52.8 cm; weight: 2804 g. 12. Geometric Ewer B. Height: 55 cm; weight: 2671 g. 13. Basin. Diameter: 45.2–46.8 cm; weight: 2118 g. 14. Casket. Height: 32 cm; weight: 2051 g. 15. Copper cauldron: Height: 32.5 cm; diameter: 83.5 cm. It is thought that the individual components of the Treasure were manufactured at different times, although there is no expert consensus about dating, with suggested ranges including: mid-fourth century AD to early-fifth century AD ; late-third century AD to late-fourth century AD ; and mid-fourth century AD to late-fourth century AD . The treasure takes its name from the Hunting (or Sevso) Plate. An inscription around the central medallion reads in translation ‘May these, O Sevso, yours for many ages be, small vessels fit to serve your offspring worthily’ , which identifies Sevso as donor or recipient of the plate . The medallion itself shows a hunting and picnic scene, including the label ‘PELSO’ positioned between a servant butchering a boar and a body of water containing fish. Mango believes ‘PELSO’ might apply to the water, the servant, the boar, or even a small dog, which is also seen close to the servant . Painter and Visy think it most likely that PELSO is intended to identify the body of water as Lacus Pelso, the Roman name for Lake Balaton in western Hungary. The findspot and early trading history of the Treasure are obscure. However, its constituent pieces are generally assumed to comprise a single find, or hoard, and not an artificially assembled collection of archaeologically unrelated pieces brought together by a modern seller in order to increase their aggregate monetary value. Impressions formed by the rims of the four large plates can be seen in the corrosion layer of the copper cauldron, and an accurately measured computer reconstruction has shown how all of the pieces could have been packed into the cauldron . Some, and perhaps all, of the Treasure was in the hands of the then Vienna-based Serbian dealer Anton Tkalec by 1980. Acting in concert with Lebanese dealer Halim Korban and London-based dealer Mansur Mokhtarzade, together they started to sell pieces to a Guernsey-based company called Art Consultancy, owned jointly by the then-recently-retired chairman of Sotheby’s, Peter Wilson (and his family), and dealer Rainer Zietz . Initial purchases were as follows: 19 November 1980, one of the geometric ewers, £48,000 ; November 1980–January 1981, the Hunting (Sevso) Plate, £225,000, and another one piece ; May 1981, the Achilles Plate, £525,000 . In June 1981, Korban obtained and supplied a Lebanese export permit for the first four pieces purchased, thus offering retrospective legitimation of ownership . More purchases followed: September 1981, the Geometric Plate, £180,000 ; December 1981, one of the Hippolytus situlae, £525,000 . All told, for their eight pieces, Wilson and Zietz paid more than £2.2 million . The continuing and escalating cost of acquiring the silver piece by piece forced Wilson and Zietz to search out further partners. Peter Mimpriss of Allen and Overy was lawyer to Wilson and was also lawyer to the Marquess of Northampton. In November 1981 he suggested to Wilson that Northampton might be interested . Wilson prepared a ten-page prospectus describing the Treasure as it then stood of eight pieces, writing that: ‘In 1980, farm workers in the Lebanon discovered on their land an underground chamber. This contained silver objects of the highest importance …’. He also emphasized that the material was accompanied by appropriate Lebanese export documentation . In 1982, Northampton viewed the material in Zurich , and on 15 September 1982 the Abraham Trust was formed to represent the interests of Wilson, Zietz and Northampton. The Trust assumed ownership of the eight pieces already bought by Wilson and Zietz , together with two further pieces purchased at the time by Northampton for £500,000 . In 1982, the collection as it was by then of ten pieces was viewed by a small number of scholars in a Rothschild bank vault in Zurich . In early 1984, the Abraham Trust tried to sell the silver to the J. Paul Getty Museum, persuading Guernsey-based antiques dealer Geoffrey Jenkinson to pose as ‘owner’ of the treasure to facilitate its sale for an eight per cent commission . In May 1984, the silver was shipped to the Getty on approval . Antiquities curator Arthur Houghton of the Getty had already questioned the validity of the associated Lebanese export documentation, however, and in March 1984 he had received confirmation that the authorizing signatures were forged and that Korban was not recognized by the Lebanese authorities as a registered dealer . Because of what it considered to be forged documentation, the Getty decided against buying the treasure . In June 1984, Peter Wilson died, and his interest in Abraham and thus the silver was taken up by his sons Philip and Tom Wilson . A few days later, Mimpriss received word from the Getty about the forged documentation . He responded by contacting Lebanese businessman Ramiz Rizk to obtain replacement documentation, which was finally obtained in 1985 at a cost of £628,000 for ‘all expenses including taxes’ . A second attempt to sell the Treasure to the Getty failed, and other museums and collectors were also holding back . In 1987, operating independently of the Abraham Trust, Northampton bought four more pieces from Korban and Tkalec at the combined price of $8.7 million : February 1987, the second Geometric Ewer and Hippolytus Situla for $3.7 million together ; April 1987, the Animal Ewer and the Meleager Plate . Export permits for these four pieces were again obtained through the mediation of Rizk in Beirut for payment of a further $460,000 . Around this time, the ‘Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement Trust’ became the sole owner of the silver, and Northampton entered into negotiations with Sotheby’s about a possible sale . In 1988 Northampton and Sotheby’s considered the acquisition of a large silver plate decorated with a Chi-Ro symbol in the centre, though expert advice suggested it was not part of the Sevso assemblage . On 10 February 1990, Sotheby’s announced the sale in New York of what it had dubbed the Sevso Treasure , with a Lebanese provenience and an estimated price of $50–100 million. Despite the Lebanese export permits, which apparently legitimized the material, Sotheby’s undertook to contact all 29 countries with territory falling inside the boundary of the fourth-century AD Roman Empire, together with UNESCO, Interpol, IFAR, and ICOM, enquiring after any adverse evidence or claims of ownership . The Sotheby’s announcement was the first public revelation of the Treasure, and the supposition that it had been found in Lebanon caused that country to file suit in the New York State Supreme Court on 15 February 1990 claiming that the export documentation was forged, that the silver had been exported illegally from Lebanon, and challenging Northampton’s claim to ownership. In March 1990 a judge impounded the treasure . In 1990, it was reported that the silver might have been found in a cave close to the Croatian town of Pula and smuggled out of Yugoslavia in the late 1970s, prompting Yugoslavia too to stake a claim for ownership. This claim was inherited and maintained by Croatia after its secession from Yugoslavia in 1991 . Finally, in 1991, Hungary announced its belief that the silver had been excavated in the vicinity of Polgárdi, 16 kilometres east of Lake Balaton, in the late 1970s, and also claimed ownership . The trial commenced in September 1993. Lebanon relinquished its claim on the eve of the trial . Seven weeks later, the jury concluded that neither Croatia nor Hungary could produce convincing evidence of provenience or ownership, thus reaffirming Northampton as the Sevso Treasure’s legal owner . Hungary and Croatia expressed their grievance, however, that the court had not scrutinised the circumstances of Northampton’s acquisition of the silver nor had it forced him to defend his own title . In early 1990, under pressure from Yugoslavia, London’s Metropolitan Police initiated a criminal investigation into the acquisition of the silver , and by July 1990 had come to believe that there was evidence to suggest a conspiracy to defraud . The police interviewed Northampton in October 1990, subsequently exonerating him of ‘any criminal intent’ and portraying him instead as the victim of a crime . By early 1991, the focus of enquiry had shifted to Peter Mimpriss , though by that time the Foreign Office, acting on the advice of a former ambassador to Washington (and by then a director of Sotheby’s ), had suggested that the investigation should be ended , and the Crown Prosecution Service had also advised that there was insufficient evidence to proceed. Although Northampton was keen for the investigation to continue, it was wound down . In March 1991, Northampton sued Peter Mimpriss and Allen and Overy for damages caused by fraud, deceit and misrepresentation in relation to the acquisition and potential sale of the Treasure between 1981 and 1990 . His claim hinged on his belief that the fraudulent export licences and the negative publicity attending the New York trial would deter any potential purchasers—the Treasure had become effectively unsaleable . In 1999, it was announced that the matter had been settled out-of-court and it was rumoured that Northampton had received £15 million in compensation . In November 2006, the silver was placed on display at Bonhams auction house in London for an invited audience of academics, curators, collectors and dealers, but it was not offered for sale . It had long been rumoured that the material bought by Northampton represented only part of the original find and that there might be eight more vessels and 185 spoons . In March 2007, The Art Newspaper claimed to have seen documents attesting to a further 187 spoons, 37 cups and five bowls, all said to be part of the original hoard . In March 2014 the Hungarian government announced that it had bought seven of the Treasure’s silver pieces along with the copper cauldron for €15 million. The pieces were the Hunting (Sevso) Plate, the Geometric Plate, both Geometric Ewers, the basin, the casket and the Dionysiac Ewer ."
"103.txt","One of the best-known cases of archaeological looting; a Moche funerary site called Huaca Rajada that was looted in 1987; the contents of an elite tomb were smuggled out of Peru and into various foreign collections. The site now known as Sipán dates from approximately 1 to 700 BC and is assigned to the Moche Culture. It is located at the village of Sipán, twenty miles east of the city of Chiclayo on Peru’s north coast. The most famous archaeological objects from Sipán come from a large man-made mound called Huaca Rajada, however the term ‘Sipán’ is now commonly used to refer both to material from Huaca Rajada and Huaca Rajada itself. The term ‘Sipán’ can also be used to refer to associated Moche archaeological areas near Huaca Rajada. At sixty feet high, Huaca Rajada is the smallest of the three pyramids at the Sipán site . By the mid-1980s Huaca Rajada had been minimally recorded by archaeologists and government survey but had not been archaeologically excavated. At the time of the looting event, some archaeologists believed that the adobe mound belonged to the Chimú culture, rather than the earlier Moche culture . Reports indicate that the spectacular Moche tombs subsequently located at Huaca Rajada were a surprise to both archaeologists and looters. Looting of Huaca Rajada Starting in the middle of November 1986 a team of looters led by an unemployed car mechanic named Ernil Bernal began to tunnel into Huaca Rajada. On or around 6 February 1987 the looters encountered Moche bricks in the ceiling of their trench. Upon locating a number of gold beads between these bricks, Ernil Bernal punctured the roof of the tunnel and a torrent of gold, silver and other Moche antiquities literally poured out on top of him . From what can be pieced together from archaeological excavation, interviews with key participants, and the results of various law enforcement investigations, the looters had located an intact elite Moche tomb . Samuel Bernal, one of the original looters of the tomb interviewed by Atwood in 2002, described finding a layer of hundreds of ceramic pots which were mostly destroyed while the looters searched for more valuable metal objects . Over the next few nights the looters filled rice sacks with gold and silver artefacts which they transported to the Bernal family house. Arguments broke out among the looters regarding how the profits from the sale of the Sipán material were going to be split. As a result, one of the looters contacted the police who, with the aid of archaeologist Walter Alva, intervened at the site and effectively halted the looting . The exact trail of many of the objects out of Sipán is unknown. Items from Sipán continue to surface on the international art market, resulting in some high profile seizures or returns. See the Encyclopedia entries on the Sipán Backflap, the Bourne Collection, and the Sipán Jewellery Seized from Sotheby’s for more information on Sipán material. See the entry on the Swetnam/Drew/Kelly smuggling ring for more information on the trafficking of objects from Sipan."
"104.txt","In mid 1994 Sotheby’s auction house published the catalogue for sale number 6625 which was held on the 15th of November in New York . Although the catalogue is filled with intriguing pieces of uncertain provenance and provenience, five lots are of particular interest: The catalogue contains neither contextual information nor ownership history for these objects. They are simply listed in a section bearing the subheadings ‘Peru‘ and ‘Property of Various Owners’ . Upon reviewing the catalogue in advance of the sale, officials at the Peruvian embassy in Washington , the design on the back of the gold beads of Lot 17 was nearly identical to those of the famous Sipán spider beads which were archaeologically excavated by Alva . Alva believed that lot 11 , listed as ‘Chavin’, may actually have been from Sipán as well. With the backing of the Peruvian government, Alva requested that Sotheby’s return lots 7, 10, 11, 17, and 18 (Atwood makes no mention of lot 7 in his list; Rose records that lots 7, 11 and 17 were requested and makes no mention of lots 10 and 18). Alva asserted that the lots were in violation of the 1990 emergency restrictions placed on the import of Sipán material into the United States . When Sotheby’s declined this request, the government of Perú formally contacted Sotheby’s was served with a seizure warrant for the suspected Sipán pieces on 14 December 1994, about a month after several of the pieces had been sold. Lots 7, 11, and 17 had been consigned by New York art dealer David Bernstein[1][2]; one of the pieces was recovered from the office of his counsel and the other two were seized from a Sotheby’s warehouse (IFAR ). The objects were taken to the New York Customs House pending investigation. Lots 10 and 18 were returned to Sotheby’s and subsequently sold . Following the seizure of the objects, Bernstein filed for their return claiming that the warrants used to confiscate the objects lacked probable cause (IFAR ). The New York Federal District Court questioned if the objects actually came from Sipán but ruled that at the very least they had been smuggled into the United States illegally. Bernstein’s motions were denied because he could not demonstrate that hardship was caused by the seizure of the items (IFAR ). The grand jury proceedings on this matter are unpublished. Eventually it was determined that lots 7, 11, and 17 should be repatriated to Peru. They were presented to then-president Alberto Fujimori on 21 May 1996 [3]. They are now in the collection of the Brüning Museum/Museo Tumbas Reales de Sipán in Lambayeque. They are thought to be the first Sipán objects seized and repatriated under the 1990 emergency cultural property restrictions . Alva believes that these pieces likely passed through the hands of Peruvian collector Raúl Apesteguía who was brutally murdered in his home by members of an antiquities cartel that he was involved with ."
"105.txt","La Corona is also known as Site Q For years this site was only known from looted archaeological material for sale on the art market; its location was unknown. It has recently been identified in the Peten region of Guatemala. In the mid 1960s a number of Maya sculptural objects, many bearing the same emblem glyph, began to appear on the art market. Although the panels and stelae could be stylistically tied to the Petén region, the site name recorded on some of the objects was one that scholars were unaware of. It quickly became clear that an interesting archaeological site, unknown to science, was being looted in the deep jungle of Guatemala. About two dozen sculptures from the unknown site have entered the international art market, including a carved panel depicting two ball players purchased in 1965 by the Art Institute of Chicago from New York antiquities dealer Walter Randall for $12,500 . Archaeologist Peter Matthews, then a graduate student at Yale, was one of the first to connect these objects, noting that many of them bore the distinct emblem glyph of a snake’s head. He called the unknown Maya city ‘Site Q’, short for ‘Que?’ or ‘Which?’ in Spanish. Matthews and his colleagues devoted a significant amount of time to tracking down, drawing, and describing all known Site Q objects in an effort to pin down exactly where these often large sculptural pieces were coming from. The list that they produced was widely circulated . An updated version of this list, including the last-known owner and approximate purchase price for each object is available online . The search for Site Q coincided with major advances in the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphic writing. Inscriptions from that site represent only a small portion of the “homeless hieroglyphs” that exist on looted Maya artefacts housed in international collections . Initially there was some speculation that Site Q was actually the heavily looted Guatemalan site of El Perú, discovered by Ian Graham in 1972. Although eferences to Site Q were found at El Perú, the syntax of these inscriptions indicated that, to the people of El Perú, Site Q was a foreign place called Sak Nikte’ or ‘White Flower’. Adding to the confusion, three of the stelae originally identified by Matthews as being from Site Q (which are now housed in the Kimbell Art Museum[1], the Rufino Tamayo Museum, and the Cleveland Museum of Art[2]) did come from El Perú, as their bases were found during archaeological excavations. Some archaeologists, notably Joyce Marcus, argued that the Site Q emblem was a variant glyph for the large site of Calakmul in Mexico. Stephen Houston and David Stewart found that place names associated with Calakmul were recorded as being under the control of Site Q on Matthews’ Site Q monuments, strengthening the claim that the snake head glyph signified Calakmul. However, the actual Site Q objects in foreign collections did not seem to match Calakmul. For example, existing monuments at Calakmul were in a poor state of preservation due to the porous nature of local stone. The Site Q objects in foreign collections were made from stronger stone and are in much better condition . Further epigraphic work indicated that Site Q was a small polity governed by the lords of Calakmul, yet its location remained unknown. It is now thought that the site of La Corona[3] is Site Q/Sak Nikte’/White Flower. La Corona was located in February 1996 when a jaguar poacher and looter turned eco-tourism promoter named Carlos Catalán led Santiago Billy, a researcher on a Conservation International campaign to protect scarlet macaws, to the heavily looted site. Billy then notified NASA archaeologist Tom Sever who detected noticeable Maya causeways in satellite imagery from the area. At that time, the site was an 8 hour drive and hike from the nearest permanent modern occupation, but was located close to an old chiclero campsite called Lo Veremos . Looting in the Petén has often been associated with chicle gum collection. Chicleros, the men who push through the deep jungle searching for chicle trees, have historically stumbled upon unknown Maya sites. Archaeologists and antiquities intermediaries alike have depended on chiclero informants. At first the link between La Corona and Site Q was not clear as monuments found during the initial archaeological survey of the site did not match the style of the Site Q corpus . However, recent research indicates that this is a product of the extremely destructive nature of site looting in the Petén: superior and well-preserved monuments were looted while inferior or poorly preserved monuments were left. Indeed, an undecorated stone staircase from La Corona and a Site Q stela in the collection of the Hudson Museum at the University of Maine have been shown through petrographic analysis to have come from the same source . Furthermore, excavations conducted at La Corona led to the discovery of a large hieroglyphic panel just beyond the extent of a looter’s trench. This panel bears names and events that are also mentioned on some of Matthews’ Site Q pieces. It may have even been carved by the same sculptor as Site Q Panel 1 . Although in some cases it is possible to match looted Maya sculptural work to their ‘carcasses’ (meaning the place where they were sawn off a larger monument or building), Ian Graham believes that the Site Q pieces were removed intact from their respective buildings and cut up with a power tool at a location with a generator . He believes that this will prevent archaeologists from matching the Site Q objects to specific structures or locations at La Corona. The convincing identification of La Corona as Site Q has not guaranteed its protection. Scientists studying macaw populations in the area have reported illegal trespassers at the site , which is located within the Laguna del Tigre National Park, and the area around La Corona faces a significant threat from individuals engaged in illegally burning park lands for agricultural uses . ‘New’ antiquities from Site Q/La Corona still appear on the market and in collections. For example, a small panel identified by Boot (2011) as being from La Corona was recently returned to Guatemala from a private collection in San Francisco. Boot reports that on 30 May 2011 the Ministerio de Cultura y Deportes, Dirección General del Patrimonio Cultural y Natural, Registro de Bienes Culturals issued Dictamen No. 06-2011/PH registering the panel which was delivered to the Guatemalan Consulate in San Francisco on 28 July 2011."
"106.txt","In the 1860s an amateur archaeologist named Sidney S. Lyon mapped several mound groups in the Wabash/Ohio areas, including more than forty mounds at what is now called Slack Farm . Slack Farm is a mound and village site which is located on the Ohio River near the mouth of the Wabash River, a few miles outside of Uniontown, Kentucky. It dates to approximately 1400 to 1650 AD and is one of around eighty archaeological sites in the area that are associated with the Caborn-Welborn culture (a Late Mississippian culture). The site has seven discrete zones each with its own cemetery. Burials at Slack Farm contain grave goods such as body adornments and pottery. The site is named after the Slack family who had owned the property for a number of years. The Slack family is thought to have discouraged illicit digging on their property , and the site was thought to be relatively safe in their hands. Although most other Mississippian sites in the area had been hit by looters by the late 1980s, Slack Farm had remained largely intact . Following the death of a member of the Slack family, however, the land became the property of another owner who leased it to two tenant farmers. While some evidence indicates that the Slack Farm tenants attempted to keep looters off the property, in the autumn of 1987 a group of ten pot hunters from surrounding states paid the tenants of Slack Farm $10,000 for permission to loot the site while the fields were lying fallow . At least 650 graves were opened by the looters over the course of two months, some with the help of heavy machinery . Eventually concerned neighbours complained about what they saw as a large-scale looting operation which had exposed human burials. Although the looting took place on on private land, any discovery of human remains in Kentucky had to be reported to state authorities; allegations of disinterments prompted an investigation . When Sergeant Miles Hart of the Kentucky State Police arrived at Slack Farm to respond to the complaint, he was prevented from entering the property by two of the ten looters. Upon obtaining a search warrant, the looters stated that the area was an ancient campsite, that they had found no human remains, and that they were within their rights to dig on private property. Yet scattered human remains were clearly visible scattered between around 450 looters holes and Hart returned with a cease and desist order, effectively stopping the looting in December of 1987 . The looters were arrested and charged by a Union County grand jury with a crime applicable in the state of Kentucky at the time: that of ‘desecrating venerated objects’, in this case human burials . In 1987 ‘desecrating venerated objects’ was a misdemeanour in Kentucky and a conviction under that charge would only have resulted in a small fine . Four of the ten men were residents of Illinois or Indiana and could not be extradited for a misdemeanour . The misdemeanour charges were dismissed in March of 1990 for lack of prosecution . As a result of the looting of Slack Farm, the state of Kentucky elevated grave desecration from a misdemeanour to a felony offence . Slack Farm is often cited as an inspiration for the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) , however NAGPRA only applies to Native American burials on federal land. The Slack Farm burials were located on private property and would not have been protected by NAGPRA. That said, Native American Groups have played a significant role in the activism following the looting of Slack Farm. Several groups claimed the human remains from Slack Farm under the “friends of the deceased” provision of Kentucky state law, a claim that was recognised by the State Medical Examiner . This has resulted in the reinterment of most of the human remains recovered from Slack Farm."
"107.txt","On 24 January 2008, US federal agents raided the premises of two antiquities dealerships and four art museums in California. The dealers were Robert Olson and the husband and wife partnership of Jonathan and Cari Markell, proprietors of Silk Roads Gallery in Los Angeles. The museums were the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), the Bowers Museum, the Pacific Asia Museum (PAM) and the Mingei International Museum. The raids were the culmination of an investigation conducted by the Internal Revenue Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that had commenced in April 2003. They were justified by evidence collected by an agent recruited from the National Park Service who had been working undercover, posing as ‘Tom Hoyt’, an IT specialist interested in purchasing antiquities and donating them to museums for a tax deduction . The investigation also seized sixteen international cargo shipments being imported into the USA and destined for Olson. Affidavits lodged with the US Central District of California Court stated probable cause to believe that Olson and Markell had been dealing in archaeological artefacts removed illegally from several south-east Asian countries, and, in Olson’s case, from federal land in the USA, in violation of the Archaeological Resources Protection Act, the National Stolen Property Act and the Cultural Property Implementation Act. The affidavits further alleged that Olson and Markell had provided artefacts with falsely inflated valuations for tax-deductable donation to museums, and that by receiving stolen artefacts the museums had enabled a conspiracy to prepare false tax returns. The investigation centered on Ban Chiang artefacts from Thailand. Olson, 79 years old at the time of the raids, was proprietor of Bobbyo Imports, and clearly considered himself to be a ‘wholesaler’, importing artefacts to be sold to collectors or other dealers . Olson claimed to have started importing Thai antiquities after a meeting in 1979 with Armand Labbé, curator at the Bowers Museum, who would arrange for material to be exhibited. Olson is quoted as saying that after a major display of his material in 1985, he paid $24,000 of his own money to print a catalogue of the exhibition, and that the market subsequently ‘exploded’ . He bought ‘hundreds and hundreds of pieces’ of Ban Chiang pottery and sold them to museum curators and collectors, including Barry MacLean, a wealthy Chicago collector . Olson would visit Thailand several times a year, buying material from a network of about six intermediaries and arranging with a shipping company for it to be shipped by air or sea to Los Angeles, where he maintained a warehouse at East Anaheim . He told ‘Hoyt’ that he had met with illegal diggers in Thailand and had photographs of looted sites . He claimed that the shipping company would mis-label or mis-decribe objects or make ‘under-the-table’ payments to Thai customs officials . This claim was validated in the documentation accompanying the seized shipments. For example, a Buddha statue was described as a ‘sitting man’, and a bronze drum was described as a ‘table’ . The possible route taken by shipments is shown on what purports to be a sample bill of lading obtained from the company Import Genius (#sample) that gives details of a 2006 ship’s cargo of ‘pottery ware’ being shipped by a Bangkok company for Bobbyo Imports, originating in Chiang Mai, and routed through Singapore to Los Angeles. By the time of the 2008 raids, Olson’s business seems to have dwindled. The warehouse was gone, and his material was stored at home and in various storage lockers. He was conducting business in Thailand over the phone, and in the United States was selling material on eBay . Olson himself attributed this decline in his business to the death of Labbé in 2005 and the loss of MacLean as major customer . He denied all charges of breaking US law, and maintained that the shipping company was solely responsible for any violations of Thai law . Olson’s customers included the Markells. Olsen claimed both to sell the Markells antiquities and to help them import pieces from South Asia . One shipment from Thailand intercepted by ICE in 2003 was addressed jointly to Olson and the Markells . Markell himself stated that he had started dealing in Thai material in 1988, at first through Olson, but also visiting Thailand himself to buy material . He claimed his suppliers would attach ‘Made in Thailand’ labels to objects to make them look modern, and would paint the tops of statues black to make them appear to be replicas . The federal investigation gathered evidence it claimed suggested that both Olson and the Markells were engaged in practices designed to enable customers to evade tax by fraudulent appraisals of artifacts intended for charitable donation to museums. ‘Tom Hoyt’ made eight separate purchases of antiquities on different occasions , with Olson and Jonathan Markell supplying both material and appraisal, and arranging introductions to relevant museum staff. At first, Olson used another California dealer, Joel Malter of Malter Galleries in Encino, for appraisals. But after Malter stopped supplying them with appraisals, he approached Susan Lerer, who was said by Olson to be Labbé’s girlfriend . Markell prepared the appraisals himself, but validated them with an electronic copy of the signature of Roxanna Brown, curator of Bangkok University’s Southeast Asian Ceramics Museum . ‘Hoyt’ also ascertained that Markell had made donations to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the name of his brother-in-law, and for at least one other named client. It was estimated that for a maximum rate taxpayer in 2008, the saving on a typical donation appraised at $5000 would be $700 . Most donations comprised more than one object, and the objects themselves were usually of low monetary value and seemingly of limited artistic interest. The same day as the California museum raids, federal agents also searched the private museum of Barry MacLean, a trustee of the Art Institute of Chicago. The affidavit alleged that he had acquired material from Olson, and Olson confirmed over the phone that MacLean had purchased $50,000–$100,000 worth of artefacts annually from him over a period of eight to ten years . A further affidavit was issued against the Malter Galleries, mentioning dealers Michael Malter and Robert Perez. Perez is alleged to have introduced ‘Hoyt’ to Olson . On 9 May 2008, in a follow-up action to the January raids, federal agents arrested Roxanna Brown when she arrived in Seattle to deliver an academic lecture. Although she had previously helped the investigation , she was now alleged to have supplied Jonathan Markell with electronic copies of her signature to be used in false validation of his appraisals . She had met the Markells during the late 1990s while studying at UCLA for a PhD, and had also visited Olson’s warehouse during that time . After her arrest, she was charged with wire fraud for allowing Markell to use her signature on appraisals . On the morning of 14 May she died of a perforated gastric ulcer while being held in federal custody and apparently denied proper medical treatment . The wire fraud charge against her was dropped, and in 2009 her son was awarded $880,000 by the US government in settlement of a civil lawsuit, which accused the federal authorities of negligence and callousness at the time of Brown’s death . In July 2011 the US Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles stated that the investigation was still ongoing , although by July 2012 no further charges had been made in connection with the raids."
"108.txt","On 17 January 1912, a group of explorers led by Royal Navy Officer Robert Falcon Scott arrived at the South Pole only to find that a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had beaten them there by a mere thirty-three days. Amundsen and Scott had been engaged in a race to become the first human to reach the pole. In his journal, Scott recounts spotting the remains of one of Amundsen’s camps on 16 January, stating: ‘The worst has happened, or nearly the worst… The Norwegians have forestalled us and are first to the pole. It is a terrible disappointment, and I am sorry for my loyal companions… All daydreams must go; it will be a wearisome return.’ He said that the day he actually reached the pole was ‘horrible’ and reported that he had not slept the night before due to shock and disappointment: ‘Great God! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority’ . Scott and his party left the pole on 19 January and after two months of struggle, starvation, and two deaths, the three remaining explorers made their final camp on 19 March. Scott is thought to have died on 29 March 1912, or perhaps a day later, based on the final entry in his diary. He is thought to have been the last of the men to die. On 12 November 1912, a search party located the bodies of Scott and his companions. They recovered the expedition’s records and then buried the tent and bodies under a cairn of snow, marking it with a rough wooden cross. Cape Evans camp and Protection of Hut Sites Although the final resting place of Scott and his team is now inaccessible, several other sites associated with their journey are well-known and have been periodically visited by Antarctic adventure tourists. In particular, Scott’s base camp at Cape Evans has been a site of constant interest. The Cape Evans campsite is an ‘Antarctic Specially Protected Area’ (ASPA) under the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS), a designation which was established when the main international Antarctic Treaty came into force in 1961 (Secretariat of the Antarctic Treaty ). ASPA sites are protected against development and tourists require a permit to visit the sites. Artefacts may not be taken from them except for approved conservation. However, according to Stuart Prior of New Zealand’s Antarctic Policy Unit, ‘hundreds if not thousands of items’ have been taken from these protected Antarctic expedition huts . The Cape Evans campsite is managed by the Antarctic Heritage Trust, a non-profit organization devoted to conserving sites of historic exploration to Antarctica’s Ross Sea Region (Antarctic Heritage Trust ). They describe Scott’s Cape Evans camp as an ‘iconic base’ with ‘8500+ artefacts associated with it’, of which around 5000 have been specifically conserved by the Trust . Discovery Hut Other sites of Scott’s expedition are known and visited by researchers and tourists. Discovery Hut, built during Scott’s 1902 Antarctic expedition and located on Hut Point, Ross Island , about 300 metres from the modern McMurdo Base, was rediscovered by a US expedition in 1956. Discovery Hut is also an ASPA (specifically ASPA No. 158, Historic Site No. 18 ). As with other ASPAs, ‘No historic relic or artefact shall be removed from [Discovery Hut], except for the purposes of restoration and/or preservation and then only in accordance with a Permit’ . Souvenirs were taken from among the preserved artefacts at the time of the hut’s rediscovery and have continued to be taken by visitors in the years since the 1961 Treaty banning such actions went into effect. For example, Australian author Thomas Keneally has admitted to one instance of theft at Discovery Hut. In 1968 he stole a large biscuit from a tin on the hut’s floor . He called the action evidence of his own past ‘vanity, venality and folly’ , and in 2003 he returned the biscuit to Antarctica via the Antarctic Heritage Trust at McMurdo. Although a stolen biscuit might seem relatively minor, in the years since its rediscovery, Discovery Hut has been robbed of much of its contents, including ‘sledges, skis, penguin skins, and homemade chessmen’ . Hut artefacts from Christie’s sale returned to Antarctica In 1957 John Claydon[1], a former Royal New Zealand Air Force pilot removed items from several historic expedition huts. These included leather sledge straps from Discovery Hut, a candle lantern from a hut associated with explorer Ernest Shackleton, a coat hook from Scott’s Cape Evans base camp hut, and a beaker and some bottles also from the Cape Evans camp . Specifically, the coat hook came from what was known to be Scott’s personal cubicle and the bottles were from the cubicle of explorer Edward Adrian Wilson . Claydon brought these items back to New Zealand as souvenirs . Claydon has stated that by the time his own expedition reached Scott’s huts, they had been ‘pretty well cleared out’ and that ‘everybody took away souvenirs, there are thousands of them all over New Zealand’ . In 1998, Claydon consigned the polar artefacts for sale at Christie’s auction house, London and they appeared as lots 210 through 214 in the catalogue for their 17 September ‘Exploration and Travel’ sale. Sir Edmund Hillary, also a New Zealander and one of the first two men to reach the summit of Mount Everest who was also very involved with polar exploration, spoke out against the sale, stating that the huts from which the artefacts were taken are sacred monuments . Both the British Foreign Office and the New Zealand Government contacted Christie’s and requested ownership and provenance data for the artefacts . Although the objects were removed prior to the 1961 treaty, the area they were taken from is under the territorial stewardship of New Zealand and it was thought possible that other restrictions against their removal may have been in place in 1957. Some commentators felt that while the removal took place before the implementation of the treaty, by offering polar artefacts taken directly from Antarctic huts, Christie’s was engaged in ‘woeful ignorance of or merely disregard for the spirit of the treaty’ [2]. Christie’s defended their decision to accept the consignment of the polar artefacts for sale. Associate director Nicholas Lambourn noted that in 1901, Scott himself had taken a flag from the hut of a prior expedition and that Scott and others purposefully left items for later explorers to use . He further argued that in 1957, the huts were in poor condition and the removal of the artefacts may have ensured their preservation[3]. However, in seeming contrast to this preservation argument, Claydon stated that the artefacts had been sitting in his garage for decades and that he ‘just wanted to get rid of the stuff’ . A few days later, officials from Christie’s announced that although they were satisfied that the consignor had title to the artefacts, Claydon had withdrawn the pieces from auction . The items were originally slated to be donated to the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, but in 1999 they were returned to their respective huts in Antarctica ."
"109.txt","The State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, a federal city in the Russian Federation, was founded by Russian Empress Catherine the Great in 1764 . With more than three million objects in its collection, it is one of the largest museums in the world, and occupies a number of landmark buildings in central St Petersburg, including the Winter Palace. Collections held at the museum are of national and international significance, and include examples of ‘paintings, graphic works, sculptures and works of applied art, archaeological finds and numismatic material’ . Security problems in Russian Museums In the wake of the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, the Russian Federation emerged with a weak state and poor political stability . The instability of both political and economic institutions led Colonel Vladimir Mefty (Chief of CID, Militia, Russian Federation), speaking at the Second International Art, Antique and Architectural Theft Conference in London in 1992, to claim that the contents of museums and churches across Russia were ‘open to theft and illegal export on a huge scale’ . Mefty told the conference and assembled media that looting of cultural objects, particularly icons and other religious objects, had grown significantly in the early 1990s, and that there was a ‘lamentable lack of security in churches and museums’ . Concerns about security of museum collections at the State Hermitage Museum were raised by the discovery of the robberies described below. In particular, it was noted that only objects on display at the Hermitage were covered by insurance, with those in storage not insured at all . Furthermore, the nature of the cataloguing, with only a fraction of the three million plus objects recorded electronically , meant that it could take up to ten years for objects to be checked against the museum inventory in what was a continual process of auditing . Additionally, as discussed at the end of this piece, there were concerns aired at the time that the official story of the thefts that emerged may have been inaccurate. Discovery of the thefts During the inventory audit of the collection of Russian art at the Hermitage in 2005, one of the curators, Larisa Zavadskaya, died at her desk . It was believed that Zavadskaya, a sufferer of diabetes, had had a heart attack. By the summer of 2006 it had become clear that this particular museum department had lost some 226 objects . ‘The stolen items included jewel-encrusted icons and other religious objects, jewellery and clocks, as well as more mundane items such as salt cellars, sugar bowls, a caviar scoop and a coffee pot’ . The official estimated value of the objects stolen was $5 million USD ; 130 million rubles . Some experts suggested that this figure was a conservative estimate, with claims that the stolen objects could raise up to $100 million USD if sold on . The thefts were publicised in the summer of 2006 shortly after their discovery, and museum representatives pointed to the likelihood of museum staff being involved in the thefts from an early stage of investigations . In an open letter of the World Wide Club of Petersburgers published on the State Hermitage Museum website, the Management Board appealed for assistance with returning the stolen objects: ‘We ask everyone who willingly or unwillingly came to own the stolen objects to demonstrate civic honesty and bravery, and to return the exhibits to the museum collections, where they belong.’ A number of objects were returned to the Russian authorities soon after the thefts were made public, with the list of missing objects published on the internet to aid dealers and collectors to identify objects that they may have unwittingly bought . Finlyandskiy railway station, St Petersburg. Photo by zakgollop. It was said that Zavadskaya had been removing objects gradually, possibly over a period of a decade or more, one by one in her hand bag . Although she had passed away during the inventory checks that led to the discovery of the thefts, her husband, a university lecturer named Nikolay Zavadsky, was arrested along with three other men. Zavadsky had been allegedly found to have in his possession receipts from pawn brokers that accounted for a number of the stolen objects . The other three men, a former member of staff at the Hermitage, another academic, and a private collector, were later acquitted, and the collector’s arrest seemed to trigger the return of other stolen objects . Some objects were returned anonymously or dumped, for example one icon was found in a large city garbage container in St Petersburg , while another icon was left in a locker at the city’s Finlyandskiy railway station . The experience of the arrest was less positive for the collector himself however, and he emerged from custody with a mysterious eye injury and a ‘mental disorder’ requiring his admission to a state hospital . A handful of dealers returned objects without the veil of anonymity once they realised that they had purchased stolen items. One St Petersburg antiques dealer, Alexander Yerofeyev, also provided insight to a US journalist, both on the nature of buying antiques from private individuals in Russia, and on his interactions with Zavadskaya, who he said had tried to sell him silver coffee and tea sets: ‘You have to understand that we don’t have heirlooms passing from one generation to another like you do in America… …Our social fabric was demolished, and three or four generations had their heirlooms confiscated, or they sold them for food, or they scratched the markings off so they could keep them… …Everyone who sells something in our shop has a story, and it is usually tragic.’ In Zavadskaya’s case, the story that she reportedly used was that she was selling the antiques on behalf of a friend who had been in a car accident and needed to raise money for treatment , a story echoed by another dealer whom she had also approached . In March 2007, the Dzerzhinsky district court found Nikolay Zavadsky guilty of stealing seventy-seven objects from the Hermitage, and sentenced him to five years in prison . Questions continue The thefts made national and international news, with many in the Russian press calling it ‘the theft of the century’ . In broader discussions of museum and archive security, it has also become a key example of the vulnerability of many museums to theft . Questions were raised about the level of security found in Russian museums, with discussion raised of the possibility of installing metal detectors in Moscow museums . Stolyarova noted that the thefts, and the emergence of many of the stolen objects in antiques shops in Moscow and St Petersburg, also reflected ‘perhaps the most troubling measure of the state of the country’s antiques market’. Furthermore, the Hermitage thefts, along with the theft of drawings by artist Yakov Chernikov from the Russian State Archive of Literature and Art in Moscow in the same year, led Russian president Vladimir Putin to order an inspection of all Russian museums and galleries , to account for the estimated 79.5 million objects held in collection . Certainly questions remain about the whereabouts of many of the stolen objects, with just thirty-one of the 226 items accounted for by the time of Zavadsky’s sentencing in 2007 , and a further icon, of the Mother of God ‘Sign’, returned in October 2008 . While many objects are believed to have made their way onto the domestic Russian antiques market, colleagues of the late curator Zavadskaya also reportedly remarked that she at one time made regular trips to Finland, but then suddenly stopped. This raised further questions about the possibility that at least some objects may have been trafficked into the European Union, and led Russian newspaper Pravda to observe that: ‘If it is to be supposed that the curator really managed to transport some of the masterpieces abroad, the search for them becomes significantly more complicated’ . The official account, then, presented a story of a curator and her family’s involvement with the gradual removal of cultural objects from the Hermitage over a significant period of time, with the suggestion that at least some of these objects may have been illegally exported out of Russia. Geraldine Norman, however, has expressed some doubts about this account, reporting the relatively humble home and possessions of the Zavadsky family, as well as the discovery of a paper trail for at least some of the objects leading from Nikolay Zavadsky to local pawn brokers known to have good relationships with the police. She went on to ask: ‘…if the Zavadsky story isn’t true, who took the pieces? Was this a simple theft of easily saleable items for personal gain? Was the theft commissioned by the local antiques trade? Was it organised by greedy insiders who have not yet been identified? Was it a provocation to discredit the museum and its director, an important player in the world of culture? If so, do his enemies just wish to shut him up or does someone want to get him sacked and take over the museum?’ It remains unclear as to whether others were involved with the Hermitage thefts, especially in light of the arrests and subsequent releases of a number of other individuals. However, it is perhaps noteworthy that allegations made in a 1998 media report profiling a leading figure in the so-called ‘Red Mafia’ (a tag often assigned to Russian criminal groups), connected both him and the Moscow-based Solntsevskaya[1] group to art trafficking and thefts from churches, private collectors and museums, including the State Hermitage Museum itself ."
"11.txt","Cancuén is a major Classic Maya site in northern Guatemala which has experienced several looting events from the 1960s into the 2000s. The Classic Maya site of Cancuén in the Petén region of Guatemala was located by Teobert Maler in 1905. In 1967 an archaeological team from Harvard discovered the remains of a palace at Cancuén that, upon subsequent excavation, turned out to be the largest known palace structure in the Maya world, with over 170 rooms and 11 patios covering more than 25,000 square metres . In 2003 a ballcourt marker (referred to as an ‘altar’ in the press) was looted from the site and then recovered through a partnership between Guatemalan authorities, archaeologists, and nearby communities (see Encyclopedia entry on the Cancuén Ballcourt Marker for more information about this object). Sometime before 1981 an extraordinary hieroglyphic panel was looted from Cancuén which was once part of a pair. The other panel is rumoured to have been lost or destroyed while it was being looted. The surviving panel is now housed in a private museum in Guatemala (see the Encyclopedia entry on the Cancuén Panel for more information about this object)."
"110.txt","On 13 June 2000, Christie’s New York offered for sale in its Antiquities sale an inscribed Neo-Assyrian stele fragment of Shamshi-Adad V . The translation of the inscription included in the catalogue entry identified it as the work of King Shamshi-Adad V, with an added text by his son and successor Adad-nerari III . For provenance, the piece was said to have been inherited from its owner’s father in the 1960s. Measuring 137.5 cm high, and weighing 930 kg, with an estimated sale price of $600,000 to $800,000, it failed to sell. The piece was published in a scholarly journal in 2012 . The author identified it as comprising the lower half of a stele, matching part of the upper half that had been discovered at the Syrian site of Tell Saih Hamad (ancient Dur-Katlimmu) in 1879 and acquired by the British Museum in 1881. The bottom half of the stele was said to be owned by a resident of Geneva and to be in Geneva on 1 November 2012. The inscription was correctly identified as the work of Adad-nerari III. A German archaeological expedition had previously surveyed Tell Saih Hamad, but found no traces of illegal digging on a scale that would match the extraction of the stele. Thus it was suggested that the piece must have been removed from the site sometime after 1879 but before 1975, which would lend credence to the 1960s provenance date supplied in the Christie’s auction catalogue . On 3 April 2014, the stele fragment was offered for sale again, this time at Bonhams London as lot 99 with an estimate of £600,000 to £800,000. It was correctly identified in the catalogue entry as a stele of Adad-Nerari III, and the provenance was again given as an inheritance in the 1960s by its Geneva owner, and that it was likely to have been removed from Tell Saih Hamad prior to 1975. It was subsequently revealed, however, that Tell Saih Hamad had been looted on 14 September 1999, and photographs of looters’ holes were obtained that seemed large enough to have contained the piece . On 31 March 2014, Bonhams withdrew the stele from sale ."
"111.txt","The following is one particularly well documented incidence of the trafficking of artefacts from Sipan. In 1987, the Moche site of Sipán in Peru was looted and objects taken from that site began to appear on the black market. Kirkpatrick interviewed a Peru-based collector named Enrico Poli who claimed that word of the major find reached Lima collecting circles quite soon after the tomb was located. After intermediaries in Trujillo sent him artefact samples from Sipán (which Poli purchased), he travelled to Trujillo with $40,000 in cash. There Poli claims to have met with a former policeman and artefact middleman named Pereda who sold him several objects from the tomb. Pereda informed Poli that more artefacts from the site existed, but that the looters were hiding the objects until police investigations had ended. While at Pereda’s house, Poli claims to have seen crutches belonging to a man named Fred Drew. Over the next few days it has been alleged that the Bernal brothers brought various Sipán objects to Pereda’s home where they were purchased by either Drew or Poli . Fred Drew was a retired American diplomat who had been functioning as a buyer and dealer of Peruvian antiquities for about 20 years before the Sipán looting . Drew purchased large portions of the Sipán collection with money provided by a US antiquities dealer named David Swetnam. With Drew focusing on the procurement of the Sipán objects, Swetnam devised a way for the pieces to be transported illegally out of Peru. According to the testimony of Michael Kelly (a member of the smuggling operation, see below), Drew and Swetnam had worked together to smuggle antiquities out of Peru in the past. Kelly alleged that Drew and Swetnam would normally have agents carry smaller antiquities on direct flights from Lima to the US, sometimes bribing Peruvian customs officers in the process . For larger shipments, mud and latex were used to cover genuine antiquities and ‘Hecho en Bolivia’ was stamped on the bottom in an attempt to make them look like souvenir items. The disguised antiquities would be shipped overland to Bolivia, flown to Vancouver, and then carried into the United States . This route worked for at least two shipments of non-Sipán material, but in 1985 a collection of ceramics and textiles sent by Drew and Swetnam was intercepted and authenticated by Canadian authorities. In evaluating how to get the Sipán material out of Peru, Swetnam decided that the Bolivia to Canada to the US route was ‘no longer viable’ . Drew and Swetnam eventually settled upon the following route which they had previously tested with two smaller shipments of non-Sipán antiquities. Drew handed the Sipán objects that he purchased over to Miguel de Osma Berckemeyer, the nephew of a former Peruvian ambassador to the United States. Berckemeyer then used family and drug cartel connections to get the objects on cargo planes headed to London. At Heathrow airport the objects were picked up by representatives of Fine Arts Services, a bonded warehouse agent, and delivered to Swetnam . Once the Sipán material was in the United Kingdom, Swetnam removed the Peruvian newspapers that were used to pack the objects and replaced them with pages from a London paper. He packed the objects in a footlocker and covered them with a raincoat belonging to the father of a man named Michael Kelly. Kelly, a British ex-pat who was the director of a small California-based company called Art Collections Conservation Network, was to receive the footlocker full of Sipán objects when they arrived in the USA. Kelly’s recently deceased father was a British subject who had travelled in South America in the 1920s. If asked, Kelly was to claim that the Sipán objects had been collected by his father during his travels, providing a plausible false provenance for the shipment. Letters bearing this story were also sent to potential buyers within the US . Both Swetnam and Kelly were present to pick up the shipment of Sipán material at Los Angeles International Airport . The shipment was labelled ‘personal effects’ and Swetnam and Kelly paid no duty on it. Customs agents did not look inside the footlocker. The men transported the Sipán objects to the home of Benjamin Bishop Johnson, a collector, dealer, and authenticator of Pre-Conquest antiquities. Johnson authenticated the shipment and purchased at least some of the items . Kelly testifies to US Customs resulting in raids On 18 September 1987, Kelly contacted United States Customs agent Gaston Wallace and indicated that he had played a role in the trafficking of a large shipment of undocumented antiquities into the United States . Kelly claimed that he got involved with Swetnam because his business was near bankruptcy . When his father died in 1986, Kelly was unable to pay for airfare back to the UK for the funeral. Swetnam offered to pay for Kelly’s plane tickets if Kelly agreed to collect illegally exported Peruvian objects in London and provide a false provenance based on his father’s death . Although Kelly admitted that he knew he was joining a smuggling operation, he stated that he did not know how deeply he was getting involved until he saw the undocumented antiquities from the Sipán shipment. He agreed to become a confidential informant and a federal investigation was initiated. On 30 March 1988 US Customs conducted a series of raids on targets identified through secret recordings made by Kelly. Among the properties raided was the home of retired Crocker Bank executive Charles Craig in Santa Barbara. Papers found in Craig’s home led investigators to the Santa Barbara Museum of Art. There investigators found twenty objects that had been in Swetnam’s inventory and another seven that Kelly identified as having been smuggled into the US by himself and Swetnam . Several of these objects thought to be from Sipán were slated to be put on display at the museum two days after the raid in an exhibit entitled ‘Diverse Directions: A Collector’s Choice’ . Thus within four months of being removed from the ground, objects from Sipán would have been placed on view in a US museum. In 1989 David Swetnam and his wife Jacqueline were charged with ten counts of conspiracy, customs violations, and other smuggling charges. Swetnam agreed to plead guilty to three counts of receiving and causing the importation of nine artefacts in an agreement that involved the charges against his wife being dropped . On 26 June 1989 Swetnam was sentenced to six months in prison. He served four months of the sentence ."
"112.txt","Tattooed and preserved Māori heads, traded primarily in the mid-nineteenth century and the subject of a number of recent repatriation requests. A seemingly pan-human fascination with death and a desire to possess the exotic has produced both a licit and an illicit market for ethnographic and archaeological human remains. The collecting of such remains peaked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a by-product of European and American colonialism. However, these items are still bought and sold on the international art and antiquities market. Of particular interest, both during the age of empire and now, are remains that display pre- or post-mortem cranial modification or preservation: mummies, modified skulls, inlayed teeth, shrunken heads, etc. Stripped of their cultural contexts and moved into a foreign setting, these remains play to a Western love of the grotesque and/or reinforce a certain stereotype of so-called savagery. The Māori Toi moko were collected for this reason; Toi moko are preserved tattooed heads. Businessman Shane Te Ruki says that his moko ‘reflects his passion for kaupapa maori’ from the Waikato Times 2009 Māori carved facial tattooing (tā moko) was a highly-personal and sacred sign of rank in pre-European New Zealand . In Māori culture, the head is considered to be the most sacred body part and the act of tattooing the head further enhances this sacredness . The intricate patterning of facial moko produced what can be likened to fingerprints: individuals were identifiable by their moko, even after death. Both men and women received facial moko, however male moko tended to cover much of the face while female moko was normally concentrated on the lips and chin . Moko began to decline among men in the 1860s[1], however women continued to receive moko into the 20th century . Tā moko has recently been revived as an outward symbol of modern Māori identity. The heads of family members or conquered enemies with moko were often preserved, a process that involved smoking the head and drying it in the sun . The resulting preserved, skin-covered skull would still display the tattooing that allowed identification of it as an individual and, thus, a revered deceased person could remain a member of his community . Depending on the circumstance, these Toi moko as the heads are called, would be used in ceremonies or, in the case of trophies of war, be displayed on posts as a point of derision . The idea of Toi moko being ‘savage’ ethnographic curios and items of trade entered Western popular culture quite early on. For example, the character of Queequeg in Herman Melville’s 1851 novel Moby-Dick, himself a heavily-tattooed native of a fictional Pacific island, is introduced to the readers by a barman: This here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ‘balmed New Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and that one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is goin’ to churches . The first sale of a Toi moko to a Westerner dates to the very first contact between Europeans and Māori. The English naturalist Joseph Banks purchased several of them on 20 January 1770 during Cook’s first voyage to New Zealand[2]. It is thought that these were enemy heads being traded as further insult . In the mid 19th century, during New Zealand’s Musket Wars, the sale of Toi moko to westerners was one of the most effective ways that Maori groups could acquire the ammunition and arms that they needed for protection . Reportedly, two heads bought one gun . Even prominent period collectors acknowledged that the sale of Toi moko was done in an effort to avoid annihilation . During the peak sale period for Toi moko it is thought that hundreds of heads were purchased and exported. The European desire for Toi moko was such that there are reports of slaves being tattooed after their death to produce heads for commercial sale resulting in tattooed heads covered in iconographic errors . By April 1831, the problems surrounding the sale of Toi mokoi were such that the General Sir Ralph Darling, Governor of New South Wales, banned their further sale in Sydney, the main route through which Toi moko were trafficked to Europe . The export of Toi moko is thought to have been slowed significantly by the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi. One of the most prominent collectors of Toi moko was Major-General Horatio Gordon Robley. He collected around 40 Toi moko, primarily from sales within the United Kingdom, despite his long tenure in New Zealand . In 1908 Robley attempted to sell his collection to the New Zealand government for £1,000 before ultimately selling 39 heads to the American Museum of Natural History for £1,250. An interesting scene of Toi moko sale can be seen in an 1896 sketch by Robley entitled ‘Maoris bargaining about mokomokai’. In it a Māori man carrying a mere (flat club) and wearing western trousers but no shirt approaches the artist and a Māori woman sits behind a decapitated Toi moko that is presumably for sale. Both Māori, themselves, have tattooed faces. A ship is seen in the background. On 16 June 1980, a Toi moko was offered at Sotheby’s London in a sale of so-called ‘Primitive Works of Art’ . Valued at £5,000 to £7,000, the Toi moko is described as being the property of the Marquis of Tavistock. This head did not sell at Sotheby’s, however it was re-offered at Bonham’s, London, in May 1988. Largely due to the work of the late musician Dalvanius Prime, himself both Māori and a descendant of , this head was removed from the sale and eventually returned to New Zealand for reburial. This is thought to be the last Toi moko offered at public auction . The return of Toi moko has been one of the primary concerns of New Zealand’s repatriation efforts, a process that many attribute to the work of Prime . Te Herekiekie Herewini, head of the repatriation team at Te Papa (the national museum of New Zealand), has noted a change in attitude concerning the return of Toi moko. ‘If you asked them 20 years ago, most of them would probably have said a flat no, but if you asked them within the last three or four years, there’s been a change in the thinking of the museums themselves’ . Because of the unique patterning of Toi moko, iwi and whānau (group and family) affiliations and even distinct individuals are sometimes identified among them. Thus, at times, it is possible to return a Toi moko to its direct descendant. However, the majority of repatriated Toi moko cannot be specifically identified and are kept in respectful storage at Te Papa and are not available for viewing ."
"113.txt","In June 2012, it was announced that the Toledo Museum of Art in Ohio, USA, had agreed to return an Etruscan black-figured kalpis to Italy . The museum had bought the kalpis in 1982 from Gianfranco and Ursula Becchina for $90,000 USD . The piece was returned to Italy in January 2013 . The Italian investigations of dealers Giacomo Medici and Gianfranco Becchina had uncovered evidence that the kalpis was smuggled out of Italy prior to 1981 in contravention of that country’s 1939 patrimony law . Medici had taken the piece to Switzerland, where he sold it to Becchina. Becchina had then devised a false provenance to pass off the piece to the Toledo Museum as a legitimate acquisition. He provided a document from an alleged hotel owner, Mr K. Haug, typewritten on hotel stationery, stating that Haug had inherited the piece from his father, who had in turn bought it on the art market in 1935 . It transpired that Haug had in reality been the previous owner of Becchina’s gallery, Antike Kunst Palladion, located in Basel . The Italian investigators also established that Becchina had used a similar false provenance for other artefacts . Polaroids of the piece were found during police searches of the storerooms of both Medici and Becchina ."
"114.txt","Lot 66 in the Bonhams London 1 May 2008 Antiquities catalogue was described as ‘An Egyptian carved limestone relief fragment Late Period, 26th Dynasty, circa 665–525 ’. The accompanying image showed the relief fragment housed in a polished wood presentation case. Its provenance was given as ‘Property of an Australian private collector, who began collecting in the 1940s whilst in the merchant navy, he ceased collecting in the 1970s when he retired from the navy due to ill health, the objects passed thence by descent to his son’. The catalogue entry also presented a partial translation of the inscription. The relief fragment was recognized by a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art as belonging to the 26th Dynasty Tomb of Mutirdis at Thebes, which had been discovered in 1969 and restored between 1973 and 1974 . The tomb reliefs had been photographed in situ and published in 1977. Upon being notified of that fact by Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities, Bonhams withdrew the piece from sale and arranged for its return to Egypt in 2008. Other fragments of relief stolen from the same tomb are still missing (SCA )."
"115.txt","Discovery of Viking-age silver, looted from a site in northern Estonia, in a German auction house, and their subsequent return, led to the first ever instance of a successful prosecution against looting and trafficking of cultural objects in Estonia. On 26 April 2005, University of Tallinn archaeologists were informed by the Estonian National Heritage Board that an amateur archaeologist had made a discovery of several artefacts in a recently-ploughed field in Salu village, Ubina, Harjumaa county, northern Estonia. Among the objects found were potsherds, half a broken silver bar, and pieces of sheet silver . After initial investigation, it was decided to carry out a rescue excavation at the site , involving archaeologists and numismatists from the National Heritage Board and the University of Tallinn . The two-week excavation uncovered evidence of structures, as well as material culture including pottery fragments, penannular brooches and other jewellery, and silver coins—the Silver Hoard of Ubina . Some material, such as sections of a possible earring, appear typical of Byzantine culture and likely to have traded to northern Europe during the Viking age , while coins were discovered from mints in Germany, England, Arabia and Denmark, with at least five imitation Anglo-Saxon coins originating from Sweden, as well as one Hungarian and one Byzantine coin. The latest dates of the coins recovered from the site led the archaeologists to surmise that the hoard was deposited around the start of the 12th century AD . After only the first day of the rescue excavation, ‘illegal archaeologists robbed the site, digging deep holes in the marked excavation plot as well as in the cultural layer beyond’, using a metal detector to assist them . Nobody was caught in the act of looting, but footprints were found across the site . During the excavation period, a car was seen circling the site, which disappeared quickly when it was spotted by archaeologists. They were, however, able to note the car’s registration number . For the rest of the excavation period, it was decided to enlist the help of the Estonian Defence League, a voluntary division of the Defence Forces, along with male archaeologists from the excavation team, to keep watch, day and night, over the site to protect it from further plunder . Discovery in auction house and Prosecution The hoard itself, as recorded by the archaeologists, consisted of 283 coins, four fragments of silver jewellery, and six sheet silver fragments. In addition to this, over 100 coins were believed to have been robbed from the site . Some 108 coins were discovered later that year for sale in an auction house in the German city of Dortmund. With assistance from the German police, 42 of the coins were confiscated and returned to Estonia . Investigation of the discovery of the coins led to the identification of Walter Augsburger, a German coin dealer, as the vendor. Augsburger later informed German police that he was selling the coins on behalf of Maido Kättmann , an Estonian from Pärnu, in south western Estonia. Following the return of the coins from the German coin auction, and in light of police investigations, Kättmann was brought to court for metal detecting on the Ubina site and removing the 108 silver coins, and some pieces of jewellery . He was in the Circuit Court in 2008, and again in 2009 to appeal his guilty conviction (an appeal which failed) . In the Supreme Court in Spring 2010, he was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment . According to Ulst , ‘[t]he Court found the accused person guilty of destroying a cultural monument in a manner which causes significant damage (Art 204 of the Penal Code) and embezzlement by a group or a criminal organization (Art 201 p 4 of the Penal Code)’. Estonian archaeologists praised the prompt collaboration of police in Germany and Estonia in enabling the return of many of the coins . The coins, jewellery fragments and other artefacts retrieved from the rescue excavations and from the police intervention in Dortmund, are stored at the Institute of History in Tallinn . Black archaeology In Estonia generally, it has been acknowledged that certain archaeological sites are vulnerable to illegal metal detecting (known in the region as ‘black archaeology’—‘must- arheoloogia’ ), and by extension that there is an illicit trade in metal-detected objects. Similar to its neighbour Latvia, Estonia is considered to have a problem with people searching for material from the Second World War, including the looting of war graves to obtain name labels . In addition to this, there have in recent years been many cases of looting of older archaeological artefacts, including three cases that have gone to court: Lauritsamäe, Keila, and Ubina . Of these, Ubina is the only case at the time of writing in which criminal proceedings have been successfully brought. In 2011, new provisions were brought into force in Estonia for the regulation of metal detecting on unprotected archaeological sites, including the introduction of a compulsory license for metal-detector users ."
"116.txt","The Uigwe are several thousand historic Korean books which were removed from Korea by the French and then the Japanese during times of occupation and have been subject to successful return requests. The Uigwe comprise a collection of over 4,000 books that records the royal rituals of Korea’s Joseon (also rendered as Chosun) Dynasty. They were produced from the 1600s until the early 1900s . ‘Uigwe’ can be translated in a number of ways, but ‘Royal Protocols’ or ‘Rubrica for a State Ceremony’ convey the general function of these works. The rituals are described in prose and the text is accompanied by extensive illustrations of the proper procedure for any royal event, from the receiving of foreign missions to the rites associated with a wedding or funeral . Furthermore, the Uigwe include the details of various other cultural activities, including construction techniques for royal buildings and tombs . The illustrations are rendered in a style that is unique to the Joseon period called Banchado which is meant to portray ceremonial details with clarity . Because of their amazing detail, the Uigwe provide a clear and even schematic view of the culture of Joseon Korea’s aristocracy . Most Uigwe were written and drawn by hand, although some 18th century volumes on certain topics were created via movable type, and a single Uigwe could be comprised of several volumes of which multiple copies would be made . A superior viewing copy of a Uigwe would be retained for the king and from five to nine additional copies would be prepared. These would include a copy for each of the four national archives which were located in different parts of the country and a copy for the Office of Protocol . The Outer Gyujanggak Library (Oe-Gyujang-gak) was built in 1782 on Ganghwa-do Island and most of the royal viewing copies of the Uigwe were subsequently transferred there from Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul. During the 1866 French campaign against Korea, Ganghwa-do Island was attacked. French naval forces seized the Uigwe that were held at the Outer Gyujanggak Library, as well as a number of other royal books and cultural objects, and set fire to the building . The Uigwe were then brought to the Bibliothèque nationale de France. In 1975 a scholar named Park Byeong-sen[1] re-discovered the Uigwe while working as a librarian in the Bibliothèque nationale. Up to that point the exact whereabouts of the Uigwe seized in 1866 had been unknown. Although they had been housed in the Bibliothèque nationale since entering France, the Uigwe had been mistakenly classified as being Chinese . In July 1992 the embassy of South Korea[2] in France formally requested the return of the Uigwe . In September 1993 French President François Mitterrand returned one Uigwe volume to South Korea and promised the return of the rest. There is some speculation that this promise was related to France’s desire to sell high speed train technology to South Korea . Despite these promises, the Uigwe were listed as ‘national treasures’ in France and French law does not allow objects that are listed as ‘national treasures’ to be transferred abroad (see: ). South Korean attempts to acquire the Uigwe under permanent lease (with France retaining official ownership) were unsuccessful for nearly two decades. In February 2007, a Seoul-based Non-governmental Organisation called Cultural Action filed a lawsuit with the Paris administrative court, which requested that illegally obtained objects be excluded from the French list of national assets, thus allowing for the return of the Uigwe . The suit was rejected in December of 2009: the court acknowledged that the Uigwe had been illegally looted but decided that this fact did not preclude the books from being considered French national assets . In other words, the court ruled that the particulars of the acquisition of the Uigwe could not influence their listed status in France . At the November 2010 G-20 summit in Seoul, an agreement was made between French president Nicholas Sarkozy and South Korean president Lee Myung-bak which allowed the Uigwe to return to South Korea on a 5 year renewable loan . In 2011, 297 volumes comprising 191 Uigwe were returned to Korea from France, with France retaining formal ownership of the documents. The Uigwe in Japan In 1922 the Governor-General of Colonial Japanese Korea, Itō Hirobumi, shipped 167 Uigwe volumes from the Changdeokgung palace to Japan . The books were stored at the Imperial Household Agency in Tokyo and forgotten; their exact whereabouts were unknown until 2001 (ibid). Because they were considered lost at the time, the Uigwe did not appear on a list of cultural objects to be returned to Korea from Japan that was compiled in 1965 as part of the treaty that normalised relations between the two countries . In 2008 the city council of Seoul formally urged Japan to return the Uigwe . According to some reports North Korea, or at least some citizens of North Korea, may have been involved in the Uigwe return requests. Reporter Claire Lee spoke with a monk named Ven Hyemun who said that in 2008 he had issued a joint request for the return of documents held in Japan (not specifically the Uigwe) with a Buddhist group in North Korea . Ven Hyemun stated that South Korea had given up its right to formally request the return of additional cultural property held in Japan by signing the 1965 treaty, but that North Korea retained the ability to request the repatriation of those objects . He told Lee that he had visited North Korea around twenty times between 2007 and 2010 in an effort to have the royal documents repatriated to the Korean peninsula . In 2010, Japanese Prime Minister Kan Naoto announced that the books would be returned and in October 2011, the new Prime Minister, Noda Yoshihiko, personally brought five Uigwe volumes to Seoul in an effort to improve Korea/Japan relations . In December 2011, the remaining Uigwe volumes were returned to South Korea from Japan . The books were met at the airport by a group of 90 performers who performed ceremonies in celebration of the return of books devoted to ceremonial protocol . On 13 December 2011 a ceremony was held at the royal shrine in Jongmyo, South Korea, to inform the Joseon kings of the safe return of their royal archives . The Uigwe returned by Japan have been classified as national cultural heritage by the South Korean Cultural Heritage Administration . The Uigwe from France do not have this classification. As they are technically in South Korea on a rolling loan, they cannot be designated national cultural heritage ."
"117.txt","A 12th century Hindu sculpture stolen from Nepal in 1982 and returned from a Berlin museum in 2000. Dhulikhel, Nepal is on the ancient trade route between central Nepal and Tibet, at a natural stopping point 35 km east of Kathmandu. Five centuries of commerce brought prosperity and prosperity encouraged a flowering of both secular and religious art. The town’s old centre contains numerous temples which contain high quality pieces of Hindu sacred art. One such piece is a remarkably fine Uma Maheshwar (also Uma Maheshvara) themed stone carving which shows Shiva (Maheshvara) reclining with Parvati (Uma) surrounded by deities and animals on Mount Kailas. The 62 cm piece is made of gray limestone and is an estimated 800 years old . It was stolen from a shrine in the Wotol area of Dhulikhel in 1982. Uma Maheshwar images appear to be popular among international art collectors . Following the theft, residents of Wotol continued to place flowers and offerings on the rounded rock in the empty neighbourhood shrine where the statue had been, praying for the Uma Maheshwar’s return . The Uma Maheshwar surfaced in 1995 in the inventory of a German art dealer in Wiesbaden . It was purchased by the Museum für Indische Kunst in Berlin for $50,000 USD . Sometime after this purchase, it came to the attention of both Lain S. Bangdel and Jürgen Schick that the Uma Maheshwar was in Berlin. Since the 1980s, Bangdel and Schick had been documenting and photographing the sacred art of the Kathmandu Valley and, in particular, had been recording antiquities theft from the region . Independently, both had taken photos of the Uma Maheshwar in situ prior to its theft in 1982 which they transmitted to the Museum für Indische Kunst . This piece was certainly in Nepal long after 1956 when the Ancient Monuments Preservation Act came into effect. Article 12 of the Act criminalises theft from ancient monuments and Article 13 restricts the export of cultural objects without prior Government approval , meaning an official permit issued by the Department of Archaeology. Nepal does not issue such permits for ancient pieces destined for the private market. The former Director General of the Department of Archaeology in Kathmandu, Riddi Pradhan, has said “There is no doubt about it, nearly every one of our statues left the country as contraband, against our laws. They are stolen goods, and hence remain the property of Nepal, owned by the country and the communities where they were originally situated” . No export permit was issued for the Uma Maheshwar. The Museum für Indische Kunst, which maintains that it was unaware that the Uma Maheshwar was stolen, was receptive to Nepal’s claim for the piece. The museum’s director, Mariane Yaldiz stated that “once [we] knew the image was stolen we did not hesitate in deciding to return the relief to Nepal…it was the only correct decision” . The Uma Maheshwar was formally returned to Nepal on 28 August 2000. When asked around that time about the dealer that sold the piece to the Museum für Indische Kunst, Yaldiz reportedly said that they had disappeared . The Uma Maheshwar was not returned to Dhulikhel out of security fears as several stolen, recovered, and reinstalled sculptures had been stolen again around the time of the return . Instead the piece was initially displayed in the Patan Museum, 28 km from Dhulikhel, with eventual return to Dhulikhel considered a possibility . At the time of writing, the piece remains in the Patan Museum as Object SS 808 (Patan Museum )."
"118.txt","The Valdivia Culture occupied Ecuador’s western lowlands and coast from about 4400 BC to 1450 BC based on radiocarbon dates . Beyond the type-site of Valdivia, discovered in 1956 by Ecuadorian archaeologist Emilio Estrada, archaeologists have identified a number of Valdivia cultural sites, including San Pablo, Real Alto and Salango on the coast, and Loma Alta, Colimes, and San Lorenzo del Mate inland. At the time of the culture’s discovery, Valdivia’s pottery sequence was considered to be the oldest in the New World. The advanced age of Valdivia ceramic technology combined with observed similarities of vessel forms, inspired archaeologist Betty Meggers to argue that Valdivia had direct contact with Jomon Period Japan . Most archaeologists do not believe that there was trans-Pacific contact between the Valdivia and Japan, yet because of these suggestions, Valdivia is more familiar to non-archaeologists than other Ecuadorian cultures. Despite the controversy concerning Valdivia pottery, the culture is best known for its ceramic ‘Venus’ figurines, stone sculptures sometimes called ‘plaques’, and stone mortars with animal features (which some argue should be assigned to the later Chorrera culture), mostly produced from around 2300 to 2000 BC. The ultra-stylised zoomorphic/anthropomorphic iconography of the objects appealed to the artistic sensibilities of the 1950s and 1960s and mirrored some of the artistic trends of the age. On the art market, stone Valdivia sculptures are commonly compared to the sculptural work of Constantin Brâncuşi and Henry Moore. Looters discovered many (if not most) Valdivia cultural sites before archaeologists did. Compared to the well studied cultures of neighbouring Peru, Ecuador has garnered a relatively smaller amount of international research focus and funding which limited the amount of internal archaeological survey that was historically accomplished. Although identified as a culture in the 1950s, many of the largest Valdivia sites were not surveyed by archaeologists until the 1970s, after looters had already been through them. By the late 1970s, Valdivia sites had taken on a pitted ‘mine field’ quality. Valdivia itself, which turned out to be a peripheral or secondary site, was apparently so looted that in 1980 it was difficult to find part of the original mound that had not been significantly altered by the activity. Further archaeological work at the site was seen as futile . Damp records that local huaqueros knew the archaeology of the region ‘intimately’. At the time of Damp’s paper, looters concentrated their efforts on the “U-shaped” early Valdivia sites and all but ignored non-‘U-shaped‘ middle Valdivia sites, asserting that there was “nothing [sell-able] in them” . Huaquero knowledge was such that many Valdivia sites were located by archaeologists based on their investigations into looted objects that had appeared on the market. An example offered by Rex González : in the late 1970s the Museo Banco Central in Quito, which, at the time, had a policy that allowed it to purchase looted material in an attempt to keep Ecuadorian objects in Ecuador, was offered a number of exceptional Valdivia sculptural pieces. By questioning the dealers, authorities were able to locate a Valdivia site near the town of San Isidro. The main mound at San Isidro and the smaller mounds in nearby agricultural fields were already covered with looter’s holes by the time archaeologists arrived. Just as problematic as the looting of Valdivia sites is the ‘corrupted’ corpus of Valdivia sculptural objects that exist in international collections. Bruhns and Hammond assert that the number of Valdivia figurines in international collections does not seem to match the frequency in which these figurines have been encountered in archaeological excavations. In other words, there are far more Valdivia figurines in collections than there should be, based on estimated knowledge of the extent of past looting and the likely amount of material that looting will have produced. Furthermore, the extensive variations on the figural themes that are seen on the art market are not seen within archaeological contexts . Telling the difference between real and fake Valdivia figurines is nearly impossible . Upon visiting the site of Valdivia in 1980, Bruhns and Hammond encountered locals selling faked Valdivia figurines as real . Meggers confirmed that the faking of Valdivia figurines began during her excavations in the mid-1950s, the result of a practical joker who sought to ‘salt’ archaeological digs with fakes . Bruhns and Hammond report that the potter hired to make the original fakes continued to craft Valdivia pieces in a process that included grinding up ancient sherds for temper to improve coloration. Other fakers began producing figures and the results are available to both tourists and dealers in Ecuador’s major cities[1]. Some speculate that fakes appear in major western collections as well. Valdivia figures are a good example of the problems associated with the rapid looting of sites unknown to archaeologists. Much like the famous Cycladic figurines, the number of Valdivia figurines excavated from archaeological contexts is very small compared to the number that have appeared on the market with no contextual information. That, coupled with the known presence of an unknown number of forgeries makes even an iconographic survey of Valdivia pieces difficult or impossible. Conclusions drawn from either the limited number of figures from archaeological contexts or the general (and corrupted) corpus of figures in international collections are inherently flawed."
"119.txt","In June 2003 police raided the home of Vaman Ghiya in Jaipur (Rajasthan, India), seizing hundreds of photographs of sculptures that appeared to have been forcibly removed from Hindu temple architecture. Over the following few days the police raided a further six of his properties in Jaipur as well as storage facilities in Mathura and Delhi, altogether seizing approximately 900 antiques and antiquities. Ghiya was charged with possessing and trafficking stolen cultural property . Ghiya was proprietor of a large handicrafts saleroom in Jaipur, but the police placed him at the centre of a smuggling network that extended from rural India to the antiquities salerooms of London and New York. After a year-long investigation into his activities, the police claimed to have established that Ghiya had been purchasing stolen or looted objects from a network of intermediaries. These intermediaries were in turn obtaining material from thieves who removed it from temples or other cultural sites and institutions. Ghiya would then store material in Jaipur, Mathura or Delhi while arranging shipment abroad of objects, describing them on export documentation as handicrafts . Ghiya began selling antiquities in the late 1970s , and by the early 1980s he was consigning material to Sotheby’s London. Under police questioning, Ghiya confessed to shipping material to Geneva , where it was known he maintained three front companies (Cape Lion Logging, Megavena and Artistic Imports Corporation). These companies would transact material amongst themselves to hide any trail of illicit trade, before selling objects on to other dealers and customers, including Sotheby’s, as revealed by Peter Watson . Between 1984 and 1986, Cape Lion Logging and Megavena between them consigned 93 lots to Sotheby’s, with a combined value in the region of £58,000 . To return his money to India, Ghiya had access to British bank accounts opened by a Sotheby’s employee in the invented names of A. Yarrow and , and he also used the international Hawala remittance system, which allows the paperless transfer of money . So profitable was the relationship for Sotheby’s that in 1986, the company proposed that their India expert Brendan Lynch should visit Ghiya twice a year, at Ghiya’s expense, to discuss what objects might be suitable for sale at Sotheby’s and to set reserve prices . After Watson exposed the link between Ghiya and Sotheby’s, Lynch left the company by mutual agreement and Sotheby’s transferred their South Asian sales from London to New York , claiming to have stopped accepting consignments from Ghiya . Nevertheless, Indian police alleged that lot 135 sold on 22 September 2000 at Sotheby’s New York, described in the catalogue as a red sandstone figure of a Jina, circa twelfth century, had been stolen from Vilasgarh temple in 1999 and passed through the hands of Ghiya . Sotheby’s denied that the piece had been consigned by Ghiya . Ghiya himself claimed to have continued selling material through Christie’s auction house after 1997 . Ghiya was convicted in 2008 and sentenced to life imprisonment, though it was reported in January 2014 that the conviction had been quashed by an appeals court because of procedural irregularities during the police prosecution . The appeals court also ruled, however, that the seized material should not be returned to Ghiya. It should either be restored where possible to the dispossessed temples, or failing that, the Archaeological Survey of India should arrange for authentic material to go on display in a public museum ."
"12.txt","Classic Maya stone sculpture from the site of Cancuén, Guatemala; looted in 2001 and recovered in 2003. Note: the piece was sometimes referred to as an ‘altar’ in the press. Ballcourts are found at most major Maya archaeological sites. They were once the staging ground for the pan-Mesoamerican ball game, an extremely significant sporting activity that appears to have been tied to both religion and regional politics. Two ball courts have been located at the site of Cancuén, Guatemala, each of which would have originally housed three ballcourt markers. The exact purpose of Maya ball court markers is unknown, but they appear to factor into the rules of the game. Many of these markers are undecorated but some are finely-crafted bas-relief sculptural pieces which depict individuals, often with accompanying hieroglyphic inscriptions. Several of Cancuén’s stone monuments were recorded by archaeologist Sylvanus G. Morley in 1915, including a ballcourt marker , one of three that would have been placed within each of Cancúen’s ballcourt. Another of the three ballcourt markers was located in 2004 by a team of archaeologists from Vanderbilt University, the Universidád del Valle, and the Guatemalan Ministry of Culture led by Arthur Demarest . The third and final ballcourt marker is known to have been looted from the site in 2001. The Looting of the Ballcourt Marker Reports indicate that heavy rains in October of 2001 exposed the ballcourt marker at a time when archaeologists were not present at the site . The son of a local looter spotted the 600-pound piece. Looters removed it from the ground and took it by boat down the Pasión River . Photographs were taken of the ballcourt marker in an effort to find a buyer, and local narcotics traffickers eventually offered $4,000 USD for it. The looters held out for more money . In December 2002 the looters had a falling out and four of them covertly moved the piece across the river and buried it. However, the leader of the gang retrieved the ballcourt marker after a gun battle which was heard by residents of the nearby village . Eventually the drugs traffickers became involved again: in January of 2003 a group of men in balaclavas carrying submachine guns raided the village where they thought the ballcourt marker was hidden and savagely beat a woman who was not involved with the looters . In February 2003 concerned village elders contacted Dr. Demarest asking for help . Demarest met with the district governor, who allegedly was also the head of drug trafficking in the region, asking him to not prevent the recovery of the ballcourt marker. The district governor was shot to death only hours later, allegedly by individuals associated with drug trafficking . In March of that year the theft was reported to Guatemala’s Servícios de Investigación Criminal (). In April, the , Demarest, and archaeologist Marc Wolf raided the looters’ camp, making several arrests, but the ballcourt marker had already been sold to an unnamed antiquities dealer who had moved it about twenty miles south . A photo of the marker was recovered and widely publicised in an effort to make the piece unsellable . By August, the antiquities dealer in possession of the ballcourt marker had gotten cold feet after moving it to the border town of Melchor de Mencos with the intention of smuggling it into Belize. He sent the marker back to the Pasión River region to be buried in the ground for a few years, planning to sell it when the publicity surrounding the piece died down . Villagers informed authorities that the piece was back in the area, and it was recovered in September 2003. According to Guatemalan officials, this may have been the first time that an entire looting and dealing network was exposed in the country . Demarest asserts that the ballcourt marker was recovered primarily because of the trust relationship that he and other archaeologists and aid workers had with the local community . On 3 June 2004, three looters were each sentenced to three years in prison for their role in the looting of the Cancuén ballcourt marker . They were charged with the looting of a national monument, with the attempted sale of the monument, and with making death threats against villagers and Demarest . The looted ballcourt marker bears a date of January 796 CE. It depicts lord Tajal Chan Ahk engaged in the Maya ballgame with another lord , or two subsidiary lords from other polities playing against each other . The ballcourt marker described by Morley also depicts Tajal Chan Ahk, this time bearing the date of September 795 CE. The ballcourt marker excavated by Demarest and his team in 2004 also depicts this ruler playing ball . All three ballcourt markers are now in the National Museum of Archaeology in Guatemala City . Other Looting Incidents at Cancuén This is not the first time that Cancuén has been involved in a high profile looting case. In 1995 the New York Times reported that a fifteen minute videotape containing images of a hieroglyphic limestone panel from Cancuén was being circulated among art dealers . The looted piece reportedly had a price tag of $75,000 USD. It is now held in a private collection. See the Encyclopedia entry for the Cancuén Panel for more information about this piece."
"120.txt","Collection of José Luis Várez Fisa donated to the National Archaeological Museum of Spain in 1999. In 1999, the National Archaeological Museum of Spain in Madrid bought 181 ancient artefacts from collector José Luis Várez Fisa for a reported $12 million USD . Many of the artefacts, which are from the cultures of ancient Egypt, Italy, Greece and Spain, were placed on exhibition in 2003. In 2006 Italian researchers recognized twenty-two pieces in the catalogue of the exhibition, which appeared in photographs that were seized during raids on the premises of Italian dealers Giacomo Medici and Gianfranco Becchina. There was no evidence to suggest that Várez Fisa had dealt with either Medici or Becchina directly. He had purchased some of the artefacts in question at Sotheby’s New York, and others from US dealer Jerome Eisenberg. Eisenberg, in turn, has stated that he bought most of the artefacts at auction in London ."
"121.txt","A 2nd century Roman statue looted from Italy, acquired by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1979, and returned to Italy in 2006. Just before the beginning of the 1974 football World Cup, hosted by Germany, the Greek dealer Nikolas Koutoulakis was informed of an impressive haul of antiquities that was about to appear in the market . Among them was the statue of the Empress Vibia Sabina, wife of the Emperor Hadrian The over-life-size statue , which ‘may be dated to after the Empress’s death in 136 A.D’ and “possibly comes from Hadrian’s villa at Tivoli” , was kept in the warehouse of a Turkish dealer in Munich. Koutoulakis asked Giacomo Medici to check the object for him, since Medici was scheduled to be in Munich on 15 June to watch the football match between Italy and Haiti. After the match Medici visited the warehouse and took three Polaroid images , depicting the statue still covered with soil, lying on a wooden pallet on the floor, near other antiquities . Medici kept the Polaroid images in his archive and reported back to Koutoulakis on the condition of the statue. The statue was bought by Robert Hecht who sold it to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1979 through his conservator Fritz Bürki . Bürki seems often to have been used as an agent or ‘front’ for Hecht . Watson and Todeschini reported statements by Fritz Bürki to the effect that he was acting as a ‘front’ for Hecht, while Gill and Chippindale refer to Watson and Todeschini’s use of the term, presenting supporting evidence through the analysis of several cases of antiquities that changed hands between Bürki and Hecht, before these ended up in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Getty Museum . The museum acquired the statue using funds from the Classical Department Exchange Fund . The collecting history of the statue according to the museum was: “Said to have been in an aristocratic family collection in Bavaria” . After the raid of the Medici warehouses by the Swiss and Italian authorities on 13 September 1995 , the three Polaroid images were discovered as part of a huge archive of images and documents. Italian archaeologists Maurizio Pellegrini and Daniela Rizzo identified the statue depicted in the three Polaroids as the one exhibited in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts . On September 28, 2006, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts signed an agreement with the Italian Ministry of Culture for the return of thirteen antiquities, among which was the statue of Vibia Sabina ."
"122.txt","The Romano-British temple site at Wanborough in Surrey, England, was largely unknown and unstudied prior to a remarkable turn of events in the 1980s. In 1969 there had been a discovery of a roof tile, and a decade later in 1979 a small excavation was carried out . Then in 1983, two metal-detector users discovered some silver and gold coins, which they reported to the museum in Guildford . In England and Wales at that time, the legal procedure followed for such discoveries was treasure trove , a process through which a coroner’s inquest determined whether the objects put forward should be classed as ‘treasure’ in the legal sense . The events that followed have been described as ‘nothing short of a scandal’ . In the course of the inquest that took place the following year, the exact location of the site where the coins had been found was given out in open court , leading soon after to large scale nighthawking (looting with metal detectors) at the site . Due to the illicit nature of the metal detecting and digging that took place in the ensuing days, it is not possible to know for certain how many individuals were involved. It has been said that dealers were also present on site, buying objects as they came out of the ground , and that there were perhaps, ‘at times, 30 or 40 people digging away overnight’ . In addition, articles in treasure hunting magazines seemingly inspired treasure hunters to come to Wanborough to participate in the apparently unrestrained plundering of the site from counties as far away as Norfolk, Kent and Dorset . It is also unclear how much material was removed from the site in that initial period of looting. Some estimates have suggested that more than 20,000 individual artefacts may have been removed, and certainly at least 9,000 . The artefacts found at Wanborough have included Iron Age and Roman coins , but also other material connected to the site’s function as a temple, including a sceptre and headdresses . It has been estimated that objects were looted with a total market value at the time of £2 million , however this can also only be an approximation in the absence of precise data. A small amount of material was seized during the 1984 looting incidents by police, but much went straight to the antiquities market – and has occasionally resurfaced since . Another unknown is the destination of much of the material; ‘Some of the coins have been reported in Belgium, Switzerland and Germany; others as far afield as New Zealand’ . Material is also believed to have gone into the US market . Further material was excavated during rescue excavations and surveys in 1986 carried out by the local voluntary group Surrey Archaeological Society, but even during this authorised fieldwork further illicit metal detecting took place . Curiously too, in the same year some material that had been looted from Wanborough was sent anonymously to Surrey Archaeological Society, accompanied by a note from a ’well-wisher‘ . A feature of the looting at Wanborough that makes it particularly notable, aside from the scale of the damage to the site, is the fact that arrests were made and cases even went to court . Despite a small number of convictions resulting in fines and confiscation of a metal detector , it was widely acknowledged that the court cases actually demonstrated the need to change the Treasure Trove common law and pass new legislation that was fit for purpose . Although it took another decade, the events at Wanborough, and the tenacity of Surrey Archaeological Society in particular, have been credited with providing the catalyst for what eventually became the Treasure Act 1996 – a new law replacing Treasure Trove in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Wanborough itself, despite the scale of the looting in 1984, experienced further looting on later occasions, perhaps due to the ‘almost mythical status’ that the site had attained . Specific incidents have been in reported in 1986 (see above), 1997 , and in 2005 ."
"123.txt","In June 1994, thieves used dynamite to blast their way into the tenth-century Chinese Five Dynasties tomb of Wang Chuzhi (Xiyanchuan, Hebei Province) before removing several painted marble relief panels . On 21 March 2000, one of the panels was advertised for sale in a Christie’s New York Fine Chinese Ceramics, Paintings and Works of Art auction catalogue, whereupon it was seized by US Customs in response to a request made by the Chinese authorities. The panel had been recognized as being identical in material, technique, coloration and style to remaining panels found in situ when the tomb was excavated officially in 1995. The stolen panel had been consigned by M&C Gallery of Hong Kong and appeared in the Christie’s catalogue with a price estimate of $400,000–500,000. Surprisingly, the catalogue offered accurate provenience: it identified the panel’s relationship to those remaining in the tomb of Wang Chuzhi. The panel was returned to China on 23 May 2001."
"124.txt","Since the early 1980s, debate and dispute have surrounded two halves of a Roman sculpture dating from the Late Antonine period , “of a type known as the Weary Herakles” . Such statues were not uncommon, with many made in this period based on an original 4th Century BC sculpture by the sculptor Lyssipos of Sicyon . In 1980, excavations at Perge in southern Turkey uncovered the lower half of a Weary Herakles statue, amid rumours that looting at the site had included a large item, which many thought may well have been the top half of the same statue . In fact at the time of the excavation of the bottom half of the statue, Jale Inan, director of excavations had heard “rumors that something important had been stolen from the site” Just one year later in 1981, what would later prove to be the top half of the statue was acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), Boston, in fifty-percent partnership with collectors Shelby White and Leon Levy, and it was first exhibited the following year as part of a temporary exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York . The agreement made between the MFA and the New York-based husband and wife collectors White and Levy was that the MFA would receive full ownership upon the death of Leon Levy . Meanwhile, the bottom half of the statue was displayed in the Antalya Museum , shown in recent years in association with a photograph of the upper half of the statue . Furthermore, a “collage” of newspaper cuttings was displayed alongside the Antalya half, describing the ongoing dispute with the MFA . Although seemingly clear from photographs of both halves of the Weary Herakles, and with the corroborative, although anecdotal, reports of a theft from the Perge site not long before the top half emerged in the USA, efforts to prove the connection between the two halves were at first unproductive. Furthermore, the point that the statue type was known to have been made in reasonable abundance, suggesting that there could be numerous fragments of Weary Herakles statues in existence, had been used by MFA staff such as department head Cornelius C. Vermeule III, to cast doubt on the likelihood that the two halves were from the same statue . Three attempts were made to show that the two pieces were actually parts of the same statue, through the use of various plaster casts . Eventually, in 1992, a cast of the lower half was transported to Boston from Antalya and this satisfied observers, including Turkish officials and scholars such as the Metropolitan Museum’s former director Thomas Hoving, that the two halves were in fact of the same statue . However, even this was not initially enough to convince the MFA that their half should be repatriated to Turkey. The MFA suggested that the upper half may have broken, either naturally or accidentally, and been then separated (and exported) before the relevant law had come into force in Turkey that would have prohibited such an action . The MFA’s director of public relations at the time, Robert P Mitchell, even went on record in the Los Angeles Times in 1994, saying: ‘The Museum does not acknowledge Turkey’s claim to ownership. There has never been any evidence that the statue was stolen, and allegations to that effect were entirely unsupported…. Indeed, the break between the top and bottom halves of the statue appears to be an ancient one, such that the top half could have been removed long ago from the territory that is now known as Turkey. In the unfortunate event that the current settlement discussions are not successful, a lawsuit would be necessary. Such a case would raise significant questions.’ In 2003, Leon Levy passed away , and by 2004 the MFA had assumed full ownership of the top half of the Weary Herakles, at which point the museum reopened discussions with the Turkish government ; apparently such negotiations were made easier by not having to involve a donor in the discussions . Finally in 2011 an agreement was reached to return the MFA’s half of the statue to Turkey . Some observers have expressed surprise at how long the process has taken , and prior to the return of the statue, a lack of objection by the MFA to relevant stories run in Boston’s Globe newspaper was perceived by others almost as an admission of guilt with regard to the case . After the return, the MFA notably appointed the first ‘Curator of Provenance’ in a US museum, albeit focusing specifically on objects connected to confiscations by the Nazis during the Second World War . In addition, the return of the Weary Herakles has been attributed with building confidence within the Turkish government to pursue further repatriation claims, connected with plans for a new National Museum in Ankara which, Turkey hopes, will rival such institutions as the Louvre and the British Museum ."
"125.txt","The Mexican Shaft Tomb Tradition (or the Mexican Shaft Tomb Culture) is a mortuary practice and related culture that existed in areas of Nayarit, Jalisco and Colima from around 300 BC to 300 AD. The culture(s) that produced the shaft tombs are almost entirely defined by unprovenienced and disarticulated funerary goods. Nearly all artefacts related to this tradition have surfaced as the result of illegal looting; archaeologists did not locate an unlooted shaft tomb until 1993 even though salvage excavations had been conducted on previously looted tombs since the 1960s . Tomb Descriptions and Figure Types The figurine collection of actor Vincent Price in a Kahlua ad from the 1960s The shaft tombs themselves consist of a rectangular vertical shaft dug several metres into the soil and rock. This shaft typically opens into one or two vaulted or spherical chambers . These chambers usually contain the remains of multiple individuals, perhaps representing reuse of tombs over time by individual families. The tombs seem to have contained large amounts of grave goods, including numerous ceramic figures that have been popular on the art market for decades. The figures have been divided into several categories, however these categories are neither mutually exclusive nor are they based on careful contextual analysis. Rather they emerged in the art market as pseudo-stylistic designation in response to the growing popularity of the figures. Thus in auction catalogues, figurines from the shaft tombs are described using such terms as: ‘Ameca’ ‘Colima’, ‘Chinesco’, ‘El Arenal’, ‘Ixtlan del Rio’, ‘Nayarit’, ‘San Sebastián’, and ‘Zacatecas’. Of these, those classified as Colima are the most famous among collectors, especially those that portray small dogs . Collecting Shaft Tomb Figures A Shaft Tomb figurine in the background of Kahlo’s 1945, Self Portrait with Small Monkey The history of the collection of Mexican shaft tomb figures is tied both to the rise of modern art and to the collecting culture that existed in California in the 1950s onwards. Mexican artists Diego Rivera and Frieda Kahlo took a particular interest in the ceramics from the Mexican Shaft Tomb Tradition. They began to collect looted figures from the tombs in the 1930s and may have prompted public interest in the pieces. A ‘Nayarit’ figure appears in the background of Kahlo’s 1945 ‘Self Portrait with Small Monkey’. Sund records that by the 1950s the Shaft Tomb figures had become popular in the Los Angeles art market having been heavily promoted by such dealers as Earl Stendhal and Ralph C. Atlman. Alongside the rise in popularity of the pieces, fakes began to enter the market at this time . Use in Kahlua Ads From the mid-1960s until 1995, Mexican Shaft Tomb figurines were used in advertising campaigns for the coffee-flavoured liqueur Kahlúa. This was largely the doing of a man named Jules Berman who both collected Mexican Shaft Tomb figurines and introduced Kahlúa to the American Market . The figure collection of actor Vincent Price was featured in one of these advertisements."
"126.txt","Formative period ‘Mezcala’ figurines from Mexico that are popular on the art market but have never been found in an archaeological (and the village that shares its name) is located in the municipality of Eduardo Neri in the Mexican state of Guerrero. The site dates from the Classic and Postclassic periods , however on the art market, Xochipala is best known for Preclassic/Formative period figurines and stone bowls, which are associated with the Mezcala culture. Because of the linking of the site with this type of Preclassic figurine, the term ‘Xochipala-style’ is used on the antiquities market to describe any piece from this tradition irrespective of whether it actually came from Xochipala or if the piece dates to the Preclassic period. For example: ‘Xochipala does not represent one style or one moment in time. Rather, it is a series of sites of varying periods spanning, to be conservative, some 3,500 years’ . In other words, the term is a catch-all that has been roughly associated with a certain conception of the Mezcala culture which originated in the antiquities trade, not among archaeologists. The Mezcala: defined by looting Among the pre-Conquest cultures of Mesoamerica, comparatively little is known about the makers of Xochipala figurines, the Mezcala culture (also called the Balsas culture), primarily due to the extensive and early looting of Mezcala archaeological sites. This especially holds true for Preclassic Mezcala sites: the site of Ahuinahuac is the only Preclassic Mezcala site to have been excavated archaeologically . Because of this, the features of looted artefacts that have appeared on the art market largely define the Mezcala. Mezcala cultural sites were mined for antiquities even in pre-Conquest times. One of the largest collections of Mezcala artefacts uncovered by archaeological excavations comes from a dedicatory offering in the Great Temple at the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, a building built perhaps 1000 or more years after the Mezcala artefacts were carved. The fifty-six masks and ninety-eight figurines (which were not Xochipala-style) recovered from the Great Temple were likely excavated and re-used by the Aztec . Xochipala-style figurines Xochipala-style figurines are rendered in a highly naturalistic style. They are modeled, not molded, and are solid, not hollow. The figurines that display clothing or garments appear to have been modeled in the nude and thin sheets of clay were later applied to form clothing ‘giving the feel of cloth over the body’ . The pieces are often painted in blacks, whites, yellows and reds. Some Xochipala-style figurines are so realistic that they are said to have ‘portrait qualities’ Because of the early and systematic looting of the region, the state of Guerrero ‘has yielded evidence of prehistoric art styles that have not been associated with identifiable societies’ . Specifically, few if any cultural sites that have been excavated can be assigned to the Xochipala-style . The site of Xochipala itself post-dates Xochipala-style figurines by several hundred years and no Xochipala-style figurine has been found within a controlled archaeological context. Griffin records that according to ‘hearsay’, Xochipala-style figurines were looted from the sites of El Zacatoso (five miles from Xochipala) and Las Mesas (two miles from Xochipala). Collecting Xochipala-style figurines In the 1890s, Scottish-born mineralogist and archaeologist William Niven collected a seated female figurine that he was told came from near the village of Xochipala. The figurine, which Niven bought in the city of Chilpancingo, was sold to Harvard’s Peabody museum in 1903 along with other items from Niven’s collection . This would seem to be the first Xochipala-style figurine to be sold outside of Mexico. Xochipala-style figurines became common on the art market in the 1970s and, thus, in international museums and in private collections. Over the past few decades the Princeton University Art Museum has acquired a number of unprovenienced Xochipala-style figurines, as well as other objects associated with the Xochipala style. These have been donated by: former curator Gillett G. Griffin in 1972 and 2003 ; Peter G. Wray in 1982 [1]; Peter David Joralemon, formerly a curator at the Lowe Art Museum and now Director of Atlantic Art Partners, in 1983 , and Forrest D. Colburn, a Professor of Latin American Studies at the City University of New York, in 2003 . These donations are notable as two of the donors, Griffin and Joralemon, have produced some of the primary publications concerning Xochipala-style figurines, both describing and defining the style."
"127.txt","A Classic Maya site from which several archaeologically-recorded stelae were looted in the 1970s. Their whereabouts are unknown. The Classic Maya site of Xultun is located on high ground west of the Ixcan River, forty kilometres northeast of the site of Tikal in Guatemala’s Petén province. The site consists of a series of buildings, plazas, and several ball courts. The largest structure at Xultun is Structure B-7: each side of its nearly-square base measures about forty-five metres and it rises twenty-four metres to a platform which supports a small structure . Epigraphic study of an emblem glyph associated with the site indicates that during the Classic Maya period Xultun was called B’aax Witz or Quartz Hill/Mountain . Recording of Xultun The site was discovered in 1915 by a chiclero[1] named Aurelino Aguayo who notified archaeologists and in 1920 the Carnegie Institute mounted the first of three visits it would make to the site . Xultun was explored for three days by archaeologists Sylvanus Morley and Carl Cuthe who discovered and recorded Stelae 1 through 17 . They also named the site ‘Xultun’ or ‘end stone’, in reference to a late date recorded in the text on Stela 10 (a stela that has since been looted, see below). Less than a year later, Morley and his team spent another week at Xultun. During this visit they recorded Stelae 18 through 22 (only three further stelae have been located at Xultun) and took photographs . The Carnegie Institute visited Xultun for the last time in 1923 and archaeologists did not work at the site again until Eric von Euw mapped the area in 1974 and 1975 . Looting in the 1970s Like nearly every Maya site in the Petén, Xultun was heavily looted in the 1960s and 1970s to feed the international demand for Maya ceramics and sculptural material. Von Euw later recounted the situation that he encountered at Xultun in 1974 and 1975: In the early seventies, Stelae 3 and 12 were looted; in late 1974 Stela 10 disappeared. At the time of my first visit to the site, large trenches had been dug into Structures A-S [sic], A-7, A-9 and many smaller buildings. (The looters were active in the site when we arrived, but left four days later when it became apparent that we planned an extended stay). A year later Structures A-I, A-2, A-3, A-5 (again) and many others had been tunnelled through… Xultun has been savagely looted: more than 50 trenches have been made, representing the illicit activity of a number of men for many weeks in the removal of many tons of stone . Xultun Stela 3 (left) and Stela 22 in situ. Stela 3 was looted by 1974 and its current location is unknown (Carnegie Institute) The following information on the looted stelae is drawn from von Euw and Graham : Stela 3: This stela was found and recorded by the Carnegie Institute team in 1920 and photographed during their second expedition to the Xultun. Its front half was lying face down and its back half was standing in situ in front of a building. The carved front had been looted by 1974 . The current location of this stela is unknown. Stela 4: This stela was not looted in the 1970s, however in late 1974 Structure A-3 was looted and most of this sculpture was buried under stones extracted during the looters’ tunnelling. Stela 10: This stela was recorded by the Carnegie Institute team in 1920 and photographed during their second expedition to the Xultun. Sylvanus Morely was inspired to name the site Xultun, based on a date on this stela . It was seen lying face down at the site in 1974 but by February 1975 it had been looted. The current location of this stela is unknown . Stela 12: This stela was found and recorded in situ by the Carnegie Institute team in 1920 and photographed during their second expedition to the Xultun. By 1974 it had been stolen, reportedly having been sawn to reduce its thickness about three years before[2]. The current location of this stela is unknown. Xultun Stela 10 fallen but in situ. The location of this stela is not known (Carnegie Institute) Portable antiquities from Xultun According to Zender and Skidmore : ‘The wholesale removal of objects from Xultun’s caches and burials, coupled with the relative lack of archaeological work at the site […] means that much of what we know about Xultun historically […]comes from looted pieces.’ These allegedly looted pieces include a series of polychrome ceramic vessels that bear the emblem glyph of Xultun and/or the names of individuals associated with the site.[3] A flat dish thought to be from Xultun is in the November Collection of Maya pottery now in the possession of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston . The piece is listed as having been ‘[c]ollected between 1974 and 1981’ and its ‘place of manufacture’ is recorded as the ‘Xultún area’ (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston ). Another example of an unprovenienced vessel thought to be from Xultun is K8007 in Justin Kerr’s Maya Vase Database . The cylindrical vessel is decorated with anthropomorphic fireflies and bears the emblem glyph of Xultun. It was confiscated from a local looter and is now in the Morley Museum at Tikal, Guatemala . Recent archaeological work at Xultun In 2008 an archaeological team led by William Saturno of Boston University began systematic excavations at Xultun . In 2010 a heavily eroded mural painting exposed by a looters’ trench was discovered on the west wall of Structure 10K-2 . The looting had exposed the murals to rain and a looters’ tunnel had destroyed a portion of the mural. However, numerous inscriptions concerning astronomical cycles as well as figural depictions have been preserved."
"128.txt","‘A Northumberland National Park Voluntary Ranger patrol discovered the illegal excavations in the central area of Yeavering Bell, the largest hillfort in Northumberland and a scheduled ancient monument’ . The Iron Age hillfort site at Yeavering Bell, one of the hills in the Cheviot range in Northumberland, ‘was almost certainly constructed at some point in the first millennium BC’ . It stands in close proximity to the Anglo-Saxon palace site of Ad Gefrin, a factor that possibly reinforced the significance of the palace . Although in the stewardship of Northumberland National Park, the site belongs to landowner Lord Anthony Hill, who at the time said “National Park Staff have worked closely with local landowners over the last ten years or so through projects like ‘Discovering our hillfort Heritage’ to set up some really good management agreements for ancient monuments. These guarantee public access to many sites where it was previously impossible. Activity like this threatens all of that good work” . The illicit searching of the site may have had a negative impact for the legal metal detecting community, with reports just a few years later from local metal-detector users that it was extremely difficult to gain permission to metal detect from landowners in Northumberland . The site, which had never been excavated previously, was “left pitted with dozens of holes” – a total of 34 . The quantity and quality of material that was looted cannot be known, although anecdotal evidence from the time suggests that some ‘lesser’ metal material was left discarded on site . Although those responsible were never caught or prosecuted, the incident made national news at the time . Not unlike the events at Wanborough and its contribution to the development of the Treasure Act, the nighthawking incident at Yeavering Bell was utilised as evidence to support the passing of a change to UK law, in this case the Dealing in Cultural Objects (Offences) Bill. As Richard Allan, the Member of Parliament who proposed the Bill in the House of Commons as a Private Members Bill, remarked during Standing Committee F debate of the Bill: ‘If, as happened recently at Yeavering Bell in Northumbria, detectorists from the wrong side of town, commonly known as nighthawks, deliberately metal detect on the sites of ancient monuments … …and try to sell what they find, anyone who buys it will be caught under the Bill.’ This Private Members Bill was adopted by the Government after the looting of the Iraq National Museum in 2003 , and was eventually passed and enacted as the Dealing in Cultural Objects (Offences) Act 2003 ."
"129.txt","The ancient site of Zeugma in Turkey, now partially inundated by a dam, has experienced extensive looting, particuarly for its fine mosaics. Zeugma comprises the two ancient cities of Seleucia and Apameia sitting on opposite banks of the Euphrates in Turkey, connected by a bridge, hence ‘zeugma’ from the ancient Greek for ‘junction’ or ‘bridge’ . Belkis and Tilmuse, the modern settlements, were known to have ancient ruins for many years, but it was not until the 1970s that it was recognised for certain that these remains were actually Zeugma . Zeugma was occupied from around 300 BC, in its heyday growing to a population of some 70,000, with growing prosperity leading to a taste for frescoes and fine mosaics in many of the villas of Zeugma’s inhabitants . Economic decline, a series of attacks, and earthquakes led to the apparent abandonment of the settlement by the 11th Century AD, with no further mention of it after 1048 . It is believed that looting has taken place at Zeugma since at least the 19th Century , with one example of a looted mosaic known from 1873 . There are forty-one pieces at least of this particular mosaic, known as the ‘Provinces’ mosaic, ‘located in 11 public and private collections in 7 countries’ . Other materials from Zeugma, including statuary, portable antiquities and of course mosaics, are believed to be ‘scattered over 40 collections both inside and outside Turkey’ . It has been noted that objects listed in catalogues and collections with obscure provenances, under such terms as ‘Aintab’, ‘Upper Euphrates region’, , ‘East Mediterranean’, ‘near Syria’, ‘said to be from East Turkey’, ‘possibly from South East Anatolia’, or in one case in a museum in North Carolina ‘Roman, probably from East Turkey’ could feasibly, sometimes probably, have been looted from Zeugma . Adding to the long term looting threats facing Zeugma, an environmental challenge was introduced with the South East Anatolia Project (Güneydogῠ Anadolu Projesi – GAP) . GAP: ‘…is a multi-sector and integrated regional development effort approached in the context of sustainable development. Its basic objectives include the improvement of living standards and income levels of people so as to eliminate regional development disparities and contributing to such national goals as social stability and economic growth by enhancing productivity and employment opportunities in the rural sector.’ This development project has constructed numerous dams and hydro-electric plants in the region, including at the site of Zeugma, which was partially flooded in 2000 amid the 100 square kilometers of arid land inundated by the Birecik Dam, dispersing local residents and damaging other archaeological remains . Although the damming of the area, and associated debates concerning economic development, cultural heritage protection and sustainable energy appear seperate issues to that of looting , it was noted by Kennedy et al. that awareness of the imminent construction of the dam had likely accellerated the rate of looting in the area. Another side-effect of the Birecik Dam’s construction was the need for hasty ‘rescue’ investigation to ensure that as much of the site as possible was recorded archaeologically before it was too late . The extensive publicity given to Zeugma’s plight has been credited with securing significant funding for investigations conducted prior to the flooding of the site . In the 1990s through to 2000, various excavations took place, including a project in 2000 funded by the Packard Humanities Institute . The rescue excavation reports, particularly in two Journal of Roman Archaeology Supplementary Series volumes , noted the presence of looting. This ranged from simply not knowing whether looting had occurred or not, thus affecting the data being collected , through to using the evidence of previous looting, such as tunnels and pits, as a means of indicating ‘clues as to the depth and nature of the overburden and nature of the ancient remains at various points’ . The discovery in 1993 of a partially-looted mosaic floor led to the repatriation of ‘trafficked’ sections of the same floor back to the nearby Gaziantep Museum from the private Menil Collection in Houston, Texas . These pieces had been on loan at the time to Rice University, also in Texas . Other recent calls for repatriation have included mosaics from Bowling Green State University in Ohio, with the university quickly going public about the situation after the mosaics in their possession were identified as probably looted in January 2012 . The Gaziantep Museum houses many of the finds from Zeugma, including repatriated objects and also objects damaged by looting. For example, edges of a mosaic recovered in rescue excavations were found to match a central panel comprising the two pieces in the Menil Collection mentioned above, that had been removed by looters . While the site itself is now partially submerged due to the dam, with much of the surrounding area also inundated, it is likely that calls for repatriation will continue for pieces attributable to Zeugma, especially given the current disposition of the Turkish authorities actively to pursue cultural objects in museums and collections overseas that they believe to have been removed illegally from Turkey . See also the images of the Metiokhos and Parthenope mosaic during excavation in 1993. These can be seen in the Data section."
"13.txt","Classic Maya hieroglyphic panel looted from the site of Cancuén, Guatemala sometime before 1981. In 1981, Nicholas Hellmuth[1] received two small photographs of a Maya hieroglyphic panel from the Guatemalan site of Cancuén . This was the last anyone heard of the panel until 1994 when it appeared on the art market . In 1995 the New York Times reported that a fifteen minute videotape containing images of the panel was being circulated among art dealers . The piece reportedly had a price tag of $75,000 USD. The panel is extraordinary: 160 glyphs arranged in sixteen columns and ten rows on a slab of limestone 138 cm long and 94 cm wide . It was commissioned by lord Taj Chan Ahk, the same ruler depicted on a ballcourt marker from Cancuén (see Encyclopedia entry on the Cancuén Ballcourt Marker for more information about this object), and is a record of more than a century of the late history of the polity. It starts mid-sentence and was probably one of a pair of panels, the other of which is now lost . Conflicting rumours exist concerning the whereabouts of the lost second panel. Some believe it is still buried somewhere at Cancuén or in a private collection somewhere in Guatemala . Others report that it may have fallen into the Pasión River during a dispute between looters . Citing unnamed local sources, Kistler reports that the known panel was once part of a throne: it formed the back of the thrown and the lost panel formed the seat. Warning that her information is not verifiable, Kistler relates that a canoe carrying both pieces capsized and, because the seat of the throne was the heavier of the two pieces, it sank to the bottom of the river and could not be recovered . Kistler believes that the two panels were looted sometime during Guatemala’s 35-year civil war by members of the military and that the surviving panel was hidden until 1994, when it was offered for sale . She notes that military and guerrilla troops were operating in the deep jungle at that time and would have had access to various archaeological sites. As of 2004, the panel was in a private collection and was being displayed in the Museo El Príncipe Maya, a private museum in Cobán, Guatemala . The owner of the piece and the details of the sale in which it was acquired are not publicly known."
"14.txt","Cara Sucia is a Salvadoran archaeological site which experienced several major episodes of looting. These inspired the United States to enter into both its first UNESCO Convention-based emergency import restrictions and its first UNESCO Convention-based cultural property bilateral agreement. Cara Sucia is a major archaeological site located in western El Salvador near the border with Guatemala in the department of Ahuachapán. It was occupied during the Middle Preclassic through Late Preclassic periods starting around 166 BC, and the Late Classic through to the Terminal Classic periods. Archaeological research has shown that the later phase of occupation at Cara Sucia is strongly associated with the Cotzumalhuapa Culture of the Pacific Coast of Guatemala . During this period ‘an acropolis, two ball courts, temples, and rectangular houses were built’ and the site became an important centre for the production of figurines and whistles . The site was first recorded in the 19th century by Dr. Santiago Ignacio Barbarena, who reported the discovery of a number of artefacts including a stone jaguar head . Early interest in objects from Cara Sucia resulted in both small-scale looting and small-scale collecting. Herbert J. Spinden , for example, notes the presence of a figurine ‘accredited to Cara Sucia’ in the collection of a Dr. Alberto Luna of Mexico. Ninety Percent of Salvadoran Sites Looted Since 1903, El Salvador has prohibited the export of archaeological objects, an assertion that is supported by the country’s 1973 penal code and 1983 constitution . Despite this long-standing prohibition against the looting and trafficking of Salvadoran cultural property, ‘the National Commission for Culture and Art (CONCULTURA) and its civil counterpart the National Foundation for Archaeology (FUNDAR), estimate that 90% of the 1500 sites in the country have been looted in response to a series of stimuli including the Salvadoran civil war of the 1980s’ . The Looting of Cara Sucia Looting at Cara Sucia, El Salvador, in 1982. Photo via FUNDAR () In 1980, El Salvador embarked on a major land reform programme in an effort to develop a rural middle class and twenty-two per cent of Salvadoran farmland was transferred to landless agricultural workers. While the positive and negative aspects of this land reform have been hotly debated within El Salvador, the changes allowed for a shift in the demographics of who had access to unexcavated rural archaeological sites. Following this land reform, the site of Cara Sucia was severely looted. The looting dates to around 1980/1981, and upwards of 6000 looters’ trenches were reported on the ground . This highly destructive looting was believed to have been carried out by teams of looters who were specifically looking for stone sculptures, decorated ceramic vessels, figurines, and objects made of jade . Reports indicate that up to 600 people were looting the site daily and that both food vendors and artefact buyers ’circulated through the crowd to buy artifacts’ (FUNDAR ). The site was fenced and guards were hired in 1982, but by then the damage had already been done (FUNDAR ). Foreign Demand for Objects from Cara Sucia In 1986, Paul Amaroli embarked on a project to document the looting of the Cara Sucia region. In a 2012 interview with the newspaper El Mundo, Amaroli discussed several of his conclusions about looting in Cara Sucia and in the rest of El Salvador . Amaroli states that Salvadoran antiquities law is weak compared to other Central American countries and have not aged well over the decades. Those found guilty of the crime of smuggling cultural property face up to four years in prison, however other countries with Maya sites are reportedly able to impose harsher penalties. Amaroli considered the current demand for Salvadoran antiquities to come from the United States, Japan, and Saudi Arabia, and characterised the risks with trafficking in antiquities as being less than those in trafficking in drugs. Investigations conducted by the Government of El Salvador, Amaroli, and other archaeologists concluded that the majority of the demand for objects from Cara Sucia was in the United States. Salvadoran customs records from the late 1980s indicate that ‘thirty percent of the cases in which artefacts were confiscated [in El Salvador] involved ’ . At that time, archaeologist Stanley Boggs, who had worked in El Salvador for forty years, claimed that more than 30,000 Salvadoran artefacts were in foreign collections . Emergency Import Restrictions and a Bilateral Agreement with the United States In 1987, the USA imposed emergency import restrictions on Salvadoran Cultural Property originating from the archaeological region of Cara Sucia under section 303(a) of the Cultural Property Implementation Act following a request by the Government of El Salvador . The emergency import restrictions were extended in 1993, and in 1995 the United States and El Salvador entered into a full cultural property Memorandum of Understanding . This agreement was extended in 2000, 2005, and 2010. The 1987 emergency import restrictions and the 1995 MOU were the first agreements of their kind created by the United States under the 1970 UNESCO Convention."
"15.txt","Also known as Momia de Cerro El Plomo, the first high-altitude frozen mummy found in Chile. It was located and then hidden by looters who eventually sold it to the government. During the Inka Empire , individuals (usually children) were brought to remote high-altitude locations and ritually sacrificed. Because of the extreme cold, their bodies were unintentionally mummified, preserving their skin, hair, soft tissue, clothing, and the ritual objects associated with them. The bodies are linked to ‘capacocha’, or human sacrifice as an offering associated with fertility . Capacocha occurred during important events, for example the death of the monarch, when stability and order were sought from the gods. Physically perfect children were selected for the ritual and taken via holy procession through the empire to a sacred mountain. They were fed coca leaves and maize beer (chicha) along the way and during the ceremony, presumably to keep them docile. They were then killed via strangulation or a blow to the head, or left to die of exposure. The remarkable state of preservation of these bodies allows for a detailed analysis of Inka life and death. It also attracts looters seeking rare textile and feather artefacts in near-perfect condition. The view from atop Cerro El Plomo. Image via El Museo Nacional de Historia Natural Looting of the Cerro El Plomo Child In late January 1954, Guillermo Chacón Carrasco, Luis Gerardo Ríos Barrueto, and Jaime Ríos Abarca left the village of Puente Alto and climbed Cerro El Plomo, a peak in the Chilean Andes. Chacón was a treasure hunter and looter of archaeological sites and the group’s intent was to dig at three ancient structures upon the mountain in search of artefacts to sell. Chacón had previously looted sites on the mountain and had found some ancient silver items (Museo Nacional de Historia Natural ). The men dug in a number of spots on the mountain where they found gold and silver camelid figurines and several other ritual offerings. On 1 February, at an altitude of 5,400 metres, the group encountered the frozen body of a sacrificed Inka child . The group deposited the body in a cave and returned to Puente Alto with only the associated artefacts and ritual objects (Museo Nacional de Historia Natural ). Several weeks later the group decided to travel to Santiago in hopes of selling the objects in their possession. The Museo Histórico Nacional refused to see them, but Dr Grete Mostny, head of Anthropology from 1943 until 1964 at the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural, met with the men on 16 February . Mostny asked that the men return at the start of March when the museum director, Humberto Fuenzalida would be present. Meanwhile, Mostny went to Puente Alto to search for the stashed mummy . The looters heard about this and removed the body from the cave on 8 March. When the men returned to Santiago on 17 March, Fuenzalida attempted to buy the ritual objects but a price could not be immediately agreed upon . Eventually, the looters were paid 45,000 pesos for the body and the ritual objects that were discovered with it. . About the mummy The mummy was found to be that of a perfectly preserved Inka boy who died at the approximate age of 8. His hair had been styled into over 200 small braids tied with cord. His face had been painted with red and ochre stripes. He was dressed as a high-status individual in a red wool shirt trimmed with white leather fringe, a red wool mantel, and leather embroidered moccasins. He wore a silver armband and a headdress of black wool topped with condor feathers. A bag with the body contained locks of his hair, his nail clippings, and his baby teeth. Based on his clothing, the boy is thought to have come from the part of the Inka Empire called the Collasuyu which includes the Peru/Bolivia Altiplano and parts of northern Chile and Argentina. He is thought to have died from exposure after being placed in a rectangular sunken chamber atop the mountain (Museo Nacional de Historia Natural ). The body is now kept in the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural and is considered their most valuable anthropological piece (Museo Nacional de Historia Natural ). It is preserved in a special chamber with a humidity of between 42 and 45 per cent and a temperature between -2 and -4 degrees Celsius. The body is no longer on display at the museum in accordance with a UNESCO recommendation to not display human remains, but visitors may view a replica."
"16.txt","In September 1995, the Italian Carabinieri, in conjunction with Swiss police, raided Italian antiquities dealer Giacomo Medici’s storerooms in Geneva Freeport. The raids on Medici’s storerooms were part of a wide-ranging investigation into the antiquities trade out of Italy, and more raids followed in 2001 on US dealer Robert Hecht’s apartment in Paris and in 2002 and 2005 on Italian dealer Gianfranco Becchina’s premises in Basel. The evidence collected during the course of the Italian investigation caused several US art museums to return material to Italy, including the Cleveland Museum of , Cleveland’s then-curator of ancient art John Cooney had expressed his belief that ninety-five percent of material in the United States had been ‘smuggled in’, adding that even for ‘hot’ objects, he was only concerned to verify their legal entry into the United States, identifying Switzerland as a point of transit . Cooney described Hecht as ‘always meticulous and upright’, with ‘one of the best eyes in the business’, adding that he never asked Hecht for documents of provenance—he thought it would be ridiculous . On 19 November 2008, the Cleveland Museum and the Italian Ministry of Culture announced in a joint press release that the museum had agreed to return fourteen antiquities to Italy. For its part, Italy agreed to loan Cleveland a similar number of pieces of equivalent quality, and to organize a close association between Cleveland and an Italian institution for future collaborations. The museum director Timothy Rub was quoted as saying that the agreement absolved the museum of any intentional wrongdoing. He refused to name any dealers involved in the acquisitions , though details had already been released by Suzan Mazur . The two parties also agreed to form a joint scientific commission to research the provenance of the Apollo Sauroktonos, and also of a Roman chariot attachment depicting Victory with Cornucopia .

Sicilian plastic vase in the form of a pig , Sicily, provincial Greece, fifth century BC, c. 425 BC. Gift of Leo Mildenberg. Processional Cross , Italian, fourteenth-century AD.

"17.txt","Corbridge has one of the most documented histories of instances of nighthawking in the United Kingdom. Corbridge, the Roman garrison town on the outskirts of modern-day Corbridge in Northumberland, also known by its Latin name of Corstopitum, sits on the intersection of Roman Dere Street and Stanegate , a couple of miles south of the connected World Heritage Site of Hadrian’s Wall. The settlement and surrounding area are a Scheduled Monument[1] , and are under the stewardship of English Heritage. A museum is adjacent to the ruins of the settlement and features interpretation of the site and some of the artefacts discovered. The site is open to the public. The incidents of nighthawking at Corbridge are some of the best known examples in England . This is partly due to the diligence with which the incidents of looting have been recorded and were reported by Dobinson and Denison for the period between 1989 and 1993. However, interviews with curatorial staff who were present during this period suggest that the notoriety of the nighthawking at Corbridge may result more from the fact that metal detecting activity was so systematically monitored and recorded compared to elsewhere, rather that there was necessarily more nighthawking here than at other sites elsewhere . Monitoring by staff at the site discovered that twenty-three individual instances of nighthawking had been recorded . This translates to high levels of individual unauthorised interventions: for example between April 1989 and May 1990 the seven instances of nighthawking recorded translated as 122 ‘individual intrusions’ into the ground at the site (Ibid.). Despite police knowledge of the problem, no arrests seem to have been made during this period (Ibid.). Since the Dobinson and Denison research was carried out – which looked at the scale and impact of metal detecting across England , English Heritage have consistently employed a security firm on site. This seems to have greatly reduced the number of nighthawking incidents, although some anecdotal reports suggest incidents are still occurring in the surrounding area ."
"18.txt","In 1990 thieves stole more than 270 artifacts from the museum of the Corinth excavations in Greece. Several pieces were recovered from Christie’s New York in the late 1990s, while most of the remainder were discovered in Miami in 1999. On the night of 12 April 1990, thieves broke into the museum of the Corinth excavations in Greece. After assaulting the guard, the thieves forced open display cases and made off with more than 270 ancient Greek and Roman artefacts, recovered during 90 years of work by the American School of Classical Studies in Athens (ASCSA) . ASCSA staff quickly prepared an inventory of the stolen objects, including photographs, which was forwarded to the Greek Archaeological Service and Greek police . ASCSA also subsidised the June 1990 issue of IFAR Reports that documented with images the stolen objects . The theft was also reported in the September 1990 issue of Minerva, where some of the stolen pieces were illustrated . The burglary was the work of the so-called Karahalios gang, comprising Anastasios Karahalios, his father and brother, both called Tryfonas, together with one Ioannis Loris . By 1993, the stolen material was in Miami, where some was being stored at the home of Wilma Sabala, apparently a friend of the younger Tryfonas Karahalios. In December 1997 and March 1998, Sabala sold five pieces by auction at Christie’s New York for a total of $17,800 , including lot 103, 18 December 1997, two Attic black-figure cups, advertised as ‘The Property of an American Private Collector’, which had previously been published by ASCSA and listed by IFAR . Three of the five pieces were bought by Jerome Eisenberg, editor of Minerva and proprietor of Royal Athena Galleries in New York City . Eisenberg published one of the purchased pieces in one of his own catalogues, whereupon it was recognised by interested academics as stolen from Corinth. Eisenberg contacted the FBI and returned all three pieces, denying any knowledge that the pieces were stolen . On 7 September 1999, FBI agents in collaboration with Greek police recovered another 265 of the stolen objects in twelve plastic boxes hidden in crates of fresh fish in a Miami warehouse . Fourteen pieces were still registered missing, including three marble heads of Julius Caesar, Serapis and Eros, which were also subsequently recovered from Christie’s New York . The head of Julius Caesar was offered with no provenance as lot 136 in June 1999. The head of Serapis had been subject to some minor conservation work to make it more saleable, and a hole had been drilled for mounting on a base ; it was offered with no provenance as lot 326 in the December 1999 auction. Christie’s did not divulge the name of the consignor . On 22 January 2001, the Greek Ministry of Culture announced the return to Greece of 274 objects, with eleven still missing . Sabala was arrested in Miami in June 2000 and subsequently pled guilty to interstate transport of stolen property . In January 2000, Greek police arrested Anastasios Karahalios, discovering in his home guns, drugs and other antiquities . Loris was also arrested, but Tryfonas (sr) and Tryfonas (jr) were believed to be hiding in Venezuela . On 29 January 2001, Anastasios Karahalios was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Loris was acquitted . In March 2001, Tryfonas Karahalios (jr) was arrested in Greece for importing 25 kilos of cocaine from Venezuela routed through the Netherlands and Cyprus , and subsequently convicted of the Corinth thefts . The younger Tryfonas has always denied involvement with the thefts, and in 2008 the two brothers recounted their own version of events . Anastasios claimed to have been approached by two Greek-Americans who were friends of his uncle living in Miami George Karahalios, and who were planning to steal to order for a German collector specific pieces from the Corinth Museum. The actual theft was carried out by Anastasios and some fellow Greeks, while the Greek- American organisers waited outside. It was not possible for the thieves to remove all the requested pieces, so the Greek-Americans ordered them back instead to take what they could get. The stolen material was transported by yacht to Turkey, and then overland by truck to Aachen, Germany. By this time, because the pieces stolen were not the ‘ordered’ ones and because of the bad publicity accompanying the theft, the prospective purchaser had lost interest, and so the material was then transported via container to Miami, where it was stored in the attic of a house belonging to George Karahalios. By 1997 George Karahalios had died and his house was hit by hurricane ‘Andrew’, breaking open some of the boxes in the attic and revealing their contents. Sabbala, who it seems was the girlfriend of George Karahalios, started selling some of the material through Christie’s. It was then that Tryfonas became involved, moving the material to a new hiding place, and offering through an intermediary to arrange the return of the stolen material in return for a reward. The intermediary was then able to direct the FBI and collaborating Greek police to secure the recovery of the stolen material."
"19.txt","Pre- and post-Conquest Aymara sacred textiles removed from the village of Coroma in the 1970s and 1980s in violation of Bolivian law. The village of Coroma is located in the department of Potosí in Bolivia, 120 km north of the popular tourist destination of Uyuni and 200 km south of the city of Oruro. The villagers are ethnically Aymara or Quechua and they subsist primarily on farming and pastoralism. Because the village is relatively small and isolated, the people of Coroma have retained Indigenous forms of social organisation as well as cultural traditions that have not survived in other parts of Bolivia . One of these traditions is a reverence for ancient textile bundles known as q’epis (singular: q’epi, also kepi and quepi). Each q’epi is associated with a particular ayllu. Ayllus are kin-based moieties, ten of which are represented in Coroma. The q’epis are considered to be the clothing of the ancient founders of the ayllus, whose spirits still inhabit the garments. Individual textiles within the q’epis date from the pre-Conquest up to the late 19th century . Larger q’epi bundles contain up to fifteen garments, ‘each of which symbolizes the physical embodiment of the ayllu and is a necessary element in its well-being’ . The bundles are seen as oracles and are intimately tied to major personal and community concerns and events . Some q’epis are tended to spiritually by a rotation of family groups, others are kept at important geographic locations around the community and are cared for by a hereditary line of keepers. Stylistically speaking, Coroma textiles have been compared to the paintings of Mark Rothko . They are: ‘characteristically of rich blues, purples, and yellows, frequently bearing a central area of one colour and broad stripes or bands along the edges… [the textiles] emphasize the interplay of bands, stripes, and broad spaces and have no representational figures’ . Theft of the q’epis Q’espis being worn during the feast of All Saints from an exhibit on q’epi return held in La Paz In 1971 local authorities began to inventory the contents of the q’epis, presumably because of a series of legal and constitutional changes which resulted in both the ancient and pre-1900 historic q’epis being considered part of the cultural property of the nation of Bolivia .[1] In 1980 anthropologist Cristina Bubba and the Bolivian National Archives became involved in the Coroma textile inventory process and they were able to photograph all existing q’epi garments . During the course of the inventory, the community discovered that a number of original textiles had been clandestinely removed from the bundles and some had been replaced with non-sacred pieces. Around 200 were thought to be missing . The loss of the sacred textiles came as a shock to the community. The q’epis were thought to have been closely guarded and all visitors to Coroma were required to sign a community registry . Furthermore, the q’epi garments were rarely on public display, only being removed from their bundles for the Feast of All Souls. Yet starting in the late 1970s the names of several known dealers in Bolivian textiles appear in the community registry during the All Souls festival . It has been suggested that these dealers photographed the garments during the All Souls festival and hired intermediaries to acquire textiles to order based on these photographs . Several people in Coroma were paid to partake in this scheme. Upon discovering the thefts, local leaders barred foreign collectors and dealers from the village, yet enterprising buyers hired Bolivians to act in their stead . With the loss of the textiles, the traditional systems that had sustained the Coroma community for so long began break down . Q’epis appear on the art market Coroma textiles began to appear in North American collections shortly after the looting incident was detected. In 1983, a sufficient number of Coroma pieces were in the United States to warrant a travelling exhibit of the textiles sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution . In January 1988 archaeologist John Murra was notified via postcard that a Coroma textile was to be exhibited in San Francisco. The postcard boasted a photograph of the textile in question. Murra sent copies of this image to Cristina Bubba, who was still working with the villagers regarding their textiles, and Coroma community members positively identified the textile as having been stolen from a q’epi . Raids and seizures in the US and Canada At the urging of the Coroma community and the Bolivian government, the United States Customs began to seize Coroma material in US private collections. In February 1988, hundreds of textiles were confiscated from the premises of Steven Berger, the San Francisco dealer whose postcard advertisement had been sent to Murra. Many of the textiles from the Berger seizure were identified as coming from q’epis by the people of Coroma . In July 1988, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police intercepted a package sent to Roger Cornelius Russell Yorke by Steven Berger which contained a Coroma textile . A subsequent raid of Yorke’s residence in Truro, Nova Scotia produced over 6,000 Bolivian and Peruvian objects . Bolivia officially requested that all material seized during the raid be repatriated in April 1989 . Subsequent investigation revealed that Yorke had lived in South America for nine years and operated a store in La Paz as a vehicle through which he could purchase Indigenous textiles . He entered into a partnership with Berger in Bolivia and, upon the dissolution of their partnership, was responsible for shipping the textiles in their possession to the US and Canada . Emergency import restrictions and Bolivian law Coroma Textile Repatrated in 1992; From the Rolex Awards Website by Piotr Jaxa In May 1988 the Bolivian government formally requested that emergency import restrictions be placed on textiles from Coroma under the terms of the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. The US State Department Cultural Property Advisory committee recommended this action and in March 1989 emergency import restrictions were placed on Coroma Textiles for a period of three years. The restrictions were extended for another three years in 1993. In 2001 the US and Bolivia entered into a full cultural property bilateral agreement under the 1983 Cultural Property Implementation Act which remains in effect. In Bolivia, Supreme Decree No 21951 of 23 May 1988 was signed to clarify the intent of previous legislation regarding cultural property. It specifically states that all folk art textiles produced before 1950 are considered to be the cultural patrimony of the nation[2]. The objects are declared to be under the protection of the state and cannot be sold and can only be exported on a temporary basis for scientific and educational purposes with special permission from the relevant government , signed on 23 July 1990, deals specifically with the returns associated with the Coroma case. This is, perhaps, the first piece of Bolivian cultural property legislation that fully acknowledges an Indigenous right to ancient and ethnographic cultural objects . It states that the q’epi textiles serve to connect the people of Coroma with the past and symbolise the religious and political power of traditional authorities of the community. Furthermore, it states that q’epis are the ‘inalienable collective property of all the members of the community’, the result being that all Coroma textiles recovered during the state’s international repatriation efforts will be returned to Coroma rather than enter into the national museum system which would usually be the case. Court cases in the US, Canada, and Bolivia In 1989 attorneys Michael Ratner, Bill Verick, and Jordan Eth, working pro bono on the part of the community of Coroma, began out-of-court negotiations for the return of the textiles seized from Stephen Berger . In September 1992, forty eight Coroma textiles were officially repatriated to Bolivia. Forty three had been seized from Berger and five from one of Berger’s clients . Berger claimed that he purchased the textiles in La Paz in good faith and imported them legally into the United States (presumably while asserting that they should not be considered to be Cultural Treasure of the Nation, see above), but agreed to the return to avoid prosecution . In January 1990, Roger Yorke was charged with illegally importing Bolivian cultural property into Canada . In October 1993 Yorke unsuccessfully appealed the search and seizure on constitutional grounds . In June 1996, he became the first Canadian to be convicted under Canada’s Cultural Property Export and Import Act of 1977, having been found guilty of illegally importing 156 objects from Bolivia. He was fined 10,000 CAD . In 2002, 474 objects seized from Yorke’s residence were returned to Bolivia by the Canadian government. The community of Coroma identified 42 of these pieces as being textiles stolen from q’epis . As of 1991, four residents of Coroma had been jailed in Bolivia for their part in the textile thefts, and twelve to fourteen more had been punished by the community . Statements made by the Coroma community members punished for their involvement with the theft highlight the difficult issues surrounding poverty and cultural property theft. For example, one community member who stood trial for selling one q’epi garment stated that it was a drought year and that it was desperation and the threat of his family’s starvation that drove him to commit the crime . Statements made by community members indicate that offers made by international textile traffickers bore no relation to the actual retail value of the q’epi textiles. As a classic example of cultural property traffickers attempting to bilk an isolated Indigenous community, in 1985 a dealer attempted to convince community members to trade ALL of their textiles for two tractors . Ownership and q’epis as cultural patrimony of the nation? Offering being given to qepis from Rolex Awards Website by Piotr Jaxa A number of questions were initially raised about the legality of any potential sale that occurred prior to Supreme Decree No 21951 of 1988. To understand this issue it is important to make a distinction between the three legal classes of q’epis at that time: 1) those crafted before the conquest; 2) those crafted after the conquest but before 1900; 3) those crafted after 1900. The first class of q’epi warrants little discussion: It is clear that any q’epi crafted before the Spanish conquest was considered to be cultural property of the nation under Bolivian law and thus could not be legally bought, sold, or ’epi is slightly more complicated. The Bolivian government officially claimed that the historic q’epis are cultural property of the nation under Bolivian law . However, textile collectors and dealers claimed that textiles such as these were not, in fact, cultural property of the nation, that they had private owners and that they could be legally sold. Many felt that they had fully complied with export law in this regard. However, neither the Bolivian government nor the foreign governments participating in seizures and returns accepted this argument. According to all available rulings, pre-1900 Bolivian folk art textiles are the property of the nation. The final class of q’epis is more complex still. Until the 1988 clarification of the law, the manufacture cut-off date for an object to be considered cultural property of the nation was 1900. The argument made my some is that post-1900 textiles exported before 1988 were done so legally. While some of the q’epi garments were taken without their guardians’ knowledge, others were sold to dealers by a limited number of Coroma community members. This may therefore appear to be a case of legitimate sale rather than theft. However, certain forms of communal ownership were enshrined in the Bolivian law at the time of the looting and the legal right of Indigenous Bolivians to own property communally has been strengthened considerably in recent years . Thus, under Bolivian law, at the time of their sale, the whole Coroma community were the legal wards of the textiles and no individual caretaker had the legal right to sell any of them, even those that were not cultural property of the nation."
"2.txt","Nighthawking (illegal metal detecting) seems to be relatively rare in Scotland compared to south of the border in England, with only four known instances identified in the whole country in a UK-wide survey in 2009, a mere 2% of the total recorded instances by the survey . The report acknowledged that this low figure may be at least in part due to under-reporting , and the possibility remains of a much greater number of incidents taking place completely undetected by the authorities. However, it is also true that there are far fewer active metal-detector users, law-abiding or otherwise, in Scotland compared to England and Wales . It should also be noted that Scotland has different legislation relating to Treasure Trove than England and Wales, where the Treasure Act 1996 is in force. The Antonine Wall in is a Roman frontier stretching from Bo’ness on the River Firth in the East to Old Kilpatrick on the River Clyde in the West, built in the years following 142 AD . In 2008, it was inscribed to the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Frontiers of the Roman Empire World Heritage Site . An entry on Canmore, the database of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS), reports the discovery in 1995 at Rough Castle, a Roman fort on the Antonine Wall, of a ‘heavily-corroded Roman iron axehead’, apparently discarded after illegal metal detecting. This subsequently went to the Falkirk Museum . Oxford Archaeology also noted that one of the four instances that it recorded for nighthawking in Scotland occurred at a Roman fort along the Antonine Wall. In May 2007, signs of metal detecting in Peel Park in East Dumbartonshire were reported to Historic Scotland and the local authority by a concerned member of the public. The Antonine Wall runs through the park. The informant provided Historic Scotland with photographs of a number of small holes having been dug (these were spade-size squares), with the turf subsequently replaced. These photographs were sent to Strathclyde Police who investigated the incident. In July 2007, Historic Scotland was informed that the police had cautioned a person in Peel Park who had been caught with a metal detector; the individual claimed that he was unaware that it was a protected area. Later that year in November, Historic Scotland attended a meeting with Strathclyde Police and representatives of East Dunbartonshire Council, and subsequently provided twelve small signs for erection at agreed locations in Peel Park, advising the public that the area is protected under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 . The whole of the wall includes areas that are vulnerable to different crimes affecting the enjoyment of the environment and its heritage assets, and most recently areas in the vicinity of the Antonine Wall in the Cumbernauld area, including some kissing gates on the wall itself, have been victim to the growing problem across the UK of metal theft ."
"20.txt","Five hoards of solid gold bracelets looted from the site of Sarmizegetusa Regia, Romania, and partially recovered from the USA and other countries in Europe. The archaeological site of Sarmizegetusa Regia in Romania is the ancient capital of the Dacian kingdom. Dacia existed from 82 BC until 106 AD when the Romans conquered the area and destroyed Sarmizegetusa Regia. It is now the primary property within the UNESCO World Heritage site ‘Dacian Fortresses of the Orastie Mountains’ . Between 1999 and 2001 twenty four solid gold bracelets were looted from this site . The Looting of the Bracelets It has been alleged that Sarmizegetusa Regia was specifically targeted for looting by organized crime groups and that the metal finds from this endeavor were illegally exported to Western Europe and the United States . As of May 2011, twenty-eight Romanians have been indicted for looting at Sarmizegetusa Regia . In December 2009, thirteen of these men were given prison sentences of between seven and twelve years . Information about the find spots of the hoards can be rudimentarily reconstructed from statements made by the looters during the criminal investigation and subsequent judicial inquiry. The looters related that the gold bracelets were found along with a number of gold and silver coins and ornaments . Looted bracelets have been recovered from five hoards which were looted from five different locations at the site. Authorities have pieced together the following information about the hoards : Hoard 1: Six gold bracelets uncovered in March 1999 in an area of the site called Muchea Cetăţii. Hoard 2: One gold bracelet, 800 staters of Lysimachus type, and silver adornments uncovered in spring of 1999. The bracelet was sold at Christie’s New York on 8 December 1999 as lot 26 and has since been recovered. Hoard 3: Two gold bracelets, 200 staters, 500 tetradrachms uncovered in summer of 1999. Hoard 4: Ten gold bracelets in a cist behind a rock on the slope of Căprăreaţa Hill uncovered on 6 May 2000. The bracelets were placed in pairs in two superimposed compartments in a prepared pit. Hoard 5: Five gold bracelets found on the lower slopes of Căprăreaţa Hill. Questions of Authenticity The looters initially claimed that the bracelets were fakes made by a recently deceased associate who had melted down Greek coins to make the pieces . Although experts and authorities believed this was a story concocted to avoid punishment for looting, these initial statements made by the looters have called the authenticity of the bracelets into question . Constantinescu et al. record that the Sarmizegetusa Regia bracelets are stylistically similar to twenty-seven silver or silver gilt Dacian bracelets of known provenience that are housed in Romanian, Hungarian, and Serbian Museums. The looted bracelets bear what appear to be authentic patinas: the reddish and black spots are consistent with 2000 years of burial . Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (ED-XRF) results show that all the bracelets so far recovered feature a large amount of silver and a small amount of copper, consistent with the native gold of the region, and there is no indication that the gold was refined . Laser-Ablation Inductively-Coupled Plasma Mass-Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) conducted by Pieter Meyers in 2006 on one of the bracelets indicates that the composition of the metal is consistent with the use of natural panned gold that had not been alloyed or purified . These methods also showed that the gold used in making the bracelets was not consistent with the gold used to make Greek and Roman coinage . The scientific test results coupled with the difficulty in reproducing the ancient technology used to make the bracelets have led most scholars to conclude that the artefacts are authentic. Recovery of The Bracelets According to deputy prosecutor general Augustin Lazar of the Alba Iulia Court of Appeal’s Prosecutor’s Office, bracelets from this hoard have been recovered from American, German, and Swiss collectors . In 2006, five bracelets were returned to Romania. Four of these were purchased from an American collector for RON 800,000 , and the fifth was returned by the French government free of charge after it was seized from a stand at the Grand Palais Biennale Exhibition in Paris from a vendor who could not produce ownership documentation . According to then minister of Culture and Religious Affairs Adrian Iorgulescu: ‘The other four entered the possession]of an American owner, after [passing through] a sinuous and obscure route. He wanted to put the bracelets up for sale, and the US authorities and Interpol acted. The owner had papers attesting that he was the owner of the bracelets and the Romanian state [redeemed] them at the price he had purchased them at’ . In June 2007 a sixth bracelet was recovered by Romanian Border Police in the possession of a member of a criminal gang . Three more bracelets were repatriated in August 2007 from collectors in Switzerland and the United States, and a further three were returned from the United States in December 2008 . In May 2011, a large collection of Romanian artefacts was returned by a German antiquities collector after they were purchased by the Romanian state for 304,000 Euros . Included among the artefacts was yet another gold spiral bracelet. Eleven Bracelets Still Missing The bracelet returned from Germany was the thirteenth from the looting of Sarmizegetusa Regia to be recovered. The whereabouts of the remaining eleven are unknown[1]. Lazar has characterized the investigation as being at a half-way point, stating that ‘there is still work to be done until we get piece number 24’ . He believes that ‘the next step is initiating an international hunt for the other pieces’, but cautions that heritage is a specialized field which requires specially trained investigators . Until spring 2009 the Romanian General Police Inspectorate had a department devoted to heritage crime which included 12 officers. As of May 2011 this department had been reduced to one officer . About the Bracelets The bracelets looted from Sarmizegetusa Regia are ‘the first solid gold bracelets of Dacian craftsmanship to be discovered in Romania’ . They are spiral shaped, each with five to seven loops and snake head terminals . They range from 91 to 123 mm in diameter and weigh between 682.30 and 1196.03 grams . The bracelets were cold hammered, each from a singular rectangular gold ingot, and their decoration was applied through either punching or engraving . Gold items are unusual at Dacian sites and it is thought that these bracelets may have been symbols of authority. Some ??authorities believe the bracelets would have been worn on the upper arm; however they show no trace of use and most appear to be too large and heavy to have been worn with comfort . Others believe the bracelets were made for purely ritual purposes and served as offerings, a hypothesis supported by the alleged find spots of several of the bracelets (see below) . The recovered bracelets are now on display in the Romanian National History Museum in Bucharest ."

"22.txt","One of the most spectacular hoard discoveries in Ireland, which led first to an increase in enthusiasm for metal detecting as a hobby, but ultimately contributed to the prohibition of unlicensed searching for archaeological material. On 17 February 1980, Michael Webb and his son, also called Michael, discovered a significant hoard of early church treasure in Derrynaflan, in the townland of Lurgoe, County Tipperary, using metal detectors . The hoard included a chalice, a bronze strainer ladle and a paten (a kind of small plate) , and the discovery was described as ‘one of the most exciting events in the history of Irish art’ . The large monastic enclosure in which the hoard was found was partially protected as a National Monument . The finders reported their discovery to an archaeologist from University College Cork, Dr. Elizabeth Shee Twohig , who advised them that they must take the finds to the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin . Under Irish law at that time, the finders were entitled to a reward for making the discovery, in this case decided at IR£10,000 , although this was initially rejected by the finders as insufficient compared to the value of the find . Six years later, the High Court made a ruling that the find or its value should be returned to the finders . The public mood turned against the Webbs, who were shown on the main evening television news drinking champagne to celebrate the ruling. Ireland was then in deep recession with massive public service cuts which led to resentment that the Webbs might benefit to the tune of IR£5.5 million from the public purse . A year later, in 1987, a further final judgement was delivered by the Supreme Court that the Derrynaflan Hoard in fact belonged to the state and not to the finders . The finders finally received a reward of IR£50,000 . The impact of the case on Irish law concerning the protection of heritage was significant. Debates in the Seánad Éireann (upper house of the Irish Parliament) in 1986 indicate the split in opinions regarding the validity of the claim of the finders to the hoard (as had been decided in court the previous year), with one Senator suggesting that the state should have been trying to prove that the Webbs had no legal claim to the hoard, one Senator regarding such discoveries as no more than looting, and another claiming that the finders should instead be praised for the care with which they removed the hoard from the ground and for going to the National Museum to report the discovery . In 1987 the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill, which included clauses on metal detecting and ancient shipwrecks (another area becoming vulnerable to looting), passed through its final stages in the Dáil Éireann (lower house of the Irish Parliament) . Ireland’s National Monuments Act 1930 had prohibited the excavation of archaeological objects other than under license . However, the maximum fine for a successful prosecution at that time, at IR£10[1], proved not to be a strong deterrent . The discovery of the Derrynaflan Hoard had reputedly contributed to the growth of the metal detecting hobby in Ireland, which by the time of the discovery saw hobbyists searching not only ploughed land and other locations away from archaeological sites, but also on known archaeological sites . A 2012 Irish news item, which described an athlete as having ‘more gold than they found in Derrynaflan’ indicates that the finding of the hoard is still recalled in Irish popular memory. However, with the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1987, ‘it became illegal to search for archaeological objects with metal detectors or other electronic detecting devices without license’. A further National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994 specified the state ownership of archaeological objects, and made it ‘an offence to trade in unreported antiquities, or withhold information about archaeological discoveries’ . Under the 1994 legislation, the maximum penalty was also increased to a fine of IR£50,000 and five years imprisonment (National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994, Section 13). The National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1987 had been in preparation for many years and so was not a direct reaction solely to the controversy surrounding the hoard , although there were observations made that the upsurge in metal detecting as a result of the discovery led to changes in the law . The Derrynaflan Hoard is on permanent display at the National Museum of Ireland ."
"23.txt","Dos Cabezas is a Moche cultural site on Peru’s north coast that was the site of a major tomb looting event in the 1970s or 1980s and several recent looting incidents. The site of Zona Arqueológica Cerro Dos Cabezas is located in the Jequetepeque Valley of Peru’s North Coast and consists of approximately one square kilometre of archaeological remains, including a 105-foot terraced pyramid. The site was occupied from around AD 150 to 550 by the Moche culture. It is believed that certain sectors of the site had already been looted by the 1970s, although that material from the looting did not hit the art market until the 1980s . In the immediate aftermath of the looting of the spectacular Moche tombs at Sipán, it is likely that Dos Cabezas was looted again. In 1994 an archaeological team lead by Christopher Donnan of UCLA began rescue excavations at Dos Cabezas. Their primary goal was to explore and preserve tombs which had already been looted . Donnan went on to find several unlooted Moche tombs containing gold and silver objects. Donnan has stated that “the only [Moche] tombs that are richer are those that were excavated at Sipán” . Looting remains a perennial problem at Dos Cabezas. The core of the site is large and difficult to monitor effectively. Even daytime looting could easily go unnoticed and some reports indicate that looting incidents have occurred there while archaeologists were working within the archaeological zone . Around November of 2009 Dos Cabezas was hit by a new spree of looting incidents. Archaeologists from Peru’s Departamento de Monumentos Arqueológicos determined that a previously unknown tomb was completely sacked and a large portion of the pyramid was damaged by the digging . Sometime during the week of 5 February of 2011, Dos Cabezas was looted once again. The south-eastern side of the main pyramid at the site was damaged by around 20 different looters’ pits and an analysis of the spoil indicated that the looters had encountered another elite tomb . The looters were rumoured to be locals who were employed by known antiquities traffickers . The deputy mayor of the municipality, Fernando Isla Merino, criticised the looting and indicated that local government’s hands were tied: they were unable to protect the monument and were seeking to coordinate efforts with governmental authorities . Experts from the Dirección Regional de Cultura located twenty three recent looters’ holes at the site in late March 2011 . In August 2011 archaeologist Steve Bourget donated funds for the salaries of two round-the-clock guards to monitor site in an effort to prevent further looting . Objects thought to be from the site of Dos Cabezas appear in museum and private collections around the world and have been the subject of high profile trafficking seizures. On 5 August 2009, , New York, aboard a Swiss Air flight. The pieces are thought to have come from either Dos Cabezas or the nearby site of La Mina. They were accompanied by forged invoices that indicated the vessels had been purchased in the 1960s in Germany . The importer, German collector Anton Roeckl, was alleged to have fabricated the invoices. Roeckl returned the pieces to Peru on 2 November 2010 as part of a settlement to avoid charges ."
"24.txt","Egypt’s rich archaeological heritage has always struggled with the impact of the ‘illicit antiquities trade and illicit excavation’ . The uprisings of 2011 exacerbated this problem. As well as observations of looting and famous cases of trafficking of Egyptian antiquities, such as the Tokeley-Parry/Schultz case, there have been suggestions of corruption on the part of officials charged with protecting that resource . On 25 January 2011 a protest was staged in Cairo , leading to further uprisings and the eventual removal of Egypt’s leader Hosni Mubarak, with the Egyptian military assuming immediate control of government . Concerns were raised soon after for the safety of Egyptian antiquities, both in situ on archaeological sites and also within museums . In the early days of the uprising, much publicity was given to opportunist thefts and attacks on the Egyptian Museum on Tahrir Square in Cairo , although it became clear that other museums were also vulnerable , and it was believed that some 1,228 objects had been reported missing from sites and museums in the immediate aftermath of the demonstrations . Other reports, however, suggest that it is not possible to quantify precisely the scale of the damage that has been caused to archaeological heritage . Outside the Egyptian Museum, young people connected with the demonstrations were apparently instrumental in attempting to defend the museum from further looting, instigating protective vigilante groups to try and deflect would-be looters . Furthermore, the looting has not been limited to museums alone , with reports of incidents including: ‘Storage magazines in Dahshur, Abu Sir, Giza and the Sharm el-Sheikh area have been broken into, often by armed looters who overpowered guards. Many tombs have been targeted. The tomb of Ken-Amun in Tell el-Maskhuta, the only 19th-Dynasty tomb known in Lower Egypt, has been completely destroyed. Inscribed blocks have been stolen, and illegal excavations and construction have been reported at several sites.’ Other news reports covered raids at specific sites such as El-Hibeh , and the Abu Sir area , with the apparent increase in illegal activity affecting archaeological sites blamed widely on the ‘security vacuum’ that was caused in light of the uprisings . In addition to the increase in looting and other forms of damage affecting sites and museums, the uprising has affected the way in which heritage assets are managed within Egypt, with the dissolution of the recently-formed Ministry of Antiquities, the resignation of Zahi Hawass (formerly the head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and then Minister for Antiquities), and the reinstatement of the Supreme Council of Antiquities with a different head . The military reportedly took over the protection of the twenty-four national museums across Egypt , although other reports suggested that the effectiveness of both police and army forces for the protection of vulnerable archaeological sites from looting and other damage was questionable. For example, in the Abu Sir area, lack of police presence and ongoing disagreements between the army and quarrying companies was blamed by local residents not only for encouraging looting but also for other illegal damage of archaeological sites including unauthorised sand quarrying and dumping of refuse among and on archaeological sites . On 6 February 2012, just over a year after the beginnings of the uprising, the International Council of Museums (ICOM) launched the latest of its Red Lists series; the ‘Emergency Red List of Egyptian Cultural Objects at Risk’ ."
"25.txt","The Egyptian Museum in Cairo found itself in the centre of the 2011 Egyptian uprisings (the wider impact of which for Egypt is discussed in a separate entry), in part due to its location on Tahrir Square, upon which much of the protesting focussed . On 28 January 2011, despite apparent attempts to protect the museum and its contents , looters and protesters entered the museum – possibly up to 1,000 individuals according reports . Although looters apparently raided the museum shop for jewellery, smashed display cases, and ransacked the ticket office , it was at first unclear exactly what had been taken, with varying reports emerging suggesting different accounts of the damage caused and scale of loss of cultural objects. At the time of the break-in itself, nine individuals were reportedly arrested as they tried to make their way out of the museum via fire exits with the heads of two mummies that they had attempted to steal (but that had subsequently broken up into pieces) . The threat to the cultural objects and monuments, not only at the Egyptian Museum itself but at other museums and at archaeological sites across Egypt, was quickly recognised by archaeologists and other observers both within Egypt and further afield. The Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) issued a statement shortly after the break-in which acknowledged that the political circumstances in Cairo in 2011 were different to those surrounding the looting of the Iraq National Museum in 2003, but that nonetheless Egyptian authorities needed to act to protect the country’s universally significant cultural heritage . Other early reports emerged, primarily via the website of the then Minister for Antiquities Dr Zahi Hawass, that while there had been damage caused to up to seventy objects, apparently nothing had been stolen. A later statement from Hawass indicated that a number of objects had in fact been stolen . Recoveries and missing lists In February 2011, a several objects were recovered after apparently being discarded near to the museum. For example, in mid-February a statue of the pharaoh Akhenaten was discovered amid garbage close to Tahrir Square . Around the same time a number of other artefacts, including part of a broken, wooden sarcophagus were all found on the ground to the east of the museum . This led to suggestions that more objects would emerge through searching refuse and land in the proximity of the museum . In March 2011, a number of lists emerged of missing objects from the Egyptian Museum including a list from the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Cultural Heritage Center which was issued on 1 March 2011 , and a longer list from Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities on 15 March 2011, featuring fifty-four objects . These were intended to raise awareness but also to encourage vigilance, for example at international borders . Further recoveries of objects were made in mid and late March 2011 , and in May 2011 four statues were recovered during a ‘police action’, two of which were later confirmed to have come from the Egyptian Museum . On 6 February 2012, just over a year after the events at the Egyptian Museum, the International Council of Museums (ICOM) launched the latest of its Red Lists series at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilisation, also in Cairo , The Emergency Red List of Egyptian Cultural Objects at Risk . This list, compiled with the assistance of the Supreme Council of Antiquities and the Egyptian Museum among others, includes types of objects from museums and sites in Egypt, rather than specific pieces. Anyone finding Egyptian antiquities and other cultural material that they suspect may have been looted or stolen from Egyptian sites or museums are urged to contact the Egyptian Museum in Cairo or the Supreme Council of Antiquities . The Supreme Council of Antiquities, which had appointed a new Minister of Antiquities in December 2011 , in the same month launched a hotline for people to contact the Council, albeit intended for wider issues than just looting ."

In August 2013 Neil Kingsbury pleaded guilty to charges relating to the fraudulent misrepresentation of provenance of ancient Egyptian artefacts he had sold through auction at Christie’s and Bonhams in London . He denied knowing the material was stolen. The case hinged on six pieces he had consigned to Christie’s for their 2 May 2013 Antiquities sale . He had told Christie’s that he had inherited the pieces from his uncle who had lived in Egypt in the 1940s, and their provenance was described in the Christie’s catalogue as ’Property of a gentleman’ and ‘Private collection, UK, acquired Egypt 1940s; thence by descent’. One of the pieces, a red granite relief fragment depicting a Nubian captive , was recognized in the auction catalogue by a curator in the British Museum as having been discovered in 2000 in the temple of Amenhotep III. A colleague in Egypt confirmed that it had been stolen from a storage depot. Christie’s withdrew all six pieces from sale and alerted the police and the Egyptian embassy. Kingsbury claimed to have bought the material in a tourist shop in Egypt and brought it to Britain in a suitcase, and admitted to having previously sold another five pieces at Bonhams and eight pieces at Christie’s. The theft of the granite fragment was confirmed from an image on an Egyptian database, emphasizing the need for photographic documentation of collections to obstruct the trade in stolen material and assist police action for its recovery, though Egyptian officials pointed to the prohibitive cost of photographing and recording all objects in storage . Kingsbury was fined £500 and ordered to pay £50 costs ."
"27.txt","A collection of small Olmec figural carvings found in a single archaeological context. Busts of this style have been seen on the art market and have been seized from the collection of dealer Leonardo Patterson. Some questions have been raised around issues of authenticity. The site of El Manatí is located in the Mexican state of Veracruz, near the town of Hidalgotitlán, 60 km south of the port city of Coatzacoalcos and 15 km southeast of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, a major Olmec site. Archaeological excavations in the late 1980s and early 1990s showed that El Manatí was a sacrificial bog utilized by the Olmec culture from around 1600 to 1200 BC . Because of the anaerobic conditions of the bog, artefacts constructed out of organic material recovered from El Manatí have been found in a remarkable state of preservation. Discovery of El Manatí El Manatí came to the attention of archaeologists Ponciano Ortíz and Maria del Carmen Rodríguez in 1987 when villagers from the hamlet of El Macayal discovered at least two strange wooden sculptures, along with other artefacts while they were digging a fish pond . The villagers reported their discovery to the Veracruz Regional Centre of Mexico’s Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH). Rodríguez and Ortíz travelled to the site in 1988, they spoke to the locals who handed over their finds, and then began to excavate . El Manati Bust Detail, Photo by the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y Las Artes Wooden Busts Among the well-preserved artefacts recovered from the bog are a total of twenty wooden sculptures, usually referred to as busts, of the type originally found by locals in 1987[1]. Carbon dated to around 1200 BC, the sculptures are rendered in the so-called ‘elongated man’ style, a characteristic Olmec figurine form previously only known from ceramic and stone pieces. They are true busts: they are rendered without limbs with the head and trunk carved to the middle of the waist with a flat base so that they can stand upright . Many of the busts had been wrapped in vegetable fibre mats and ritually buried . Other ritual artefacts accompanied several of the busts , and overall they seem to have been interred as a group along a north-south axis in sets of twos and threes (Rodríguez, Ortíz, and Ogata ). The twenty wooden busts recovered by villagers and archaeologists at El Manatí represent the only known examples of this type of Olmec artefact. Generally speaking, neither the art market nor archaeology has produced wooden Olmec sculptures prior to 1989[2]. El Manatí Style Busts Seized in Spain and Germany In 1996 three El Manatí style sculptures appeared in the 1996 catalogue of a 1992 exhibition in Spain published by collector and dealer Leonardo Patterson . This same catalogue contained images of the Moche headdress from the Peruvian site of La Mina. Following a raid on his warehouse in Spain, Patterson transported a number of artefacts from Spain to Munich, ostensibly to return them to the person he claimed actually owned them. Among them was one of the three El Manatí style busts which were subsequently confiscated by German police working with Interpol . Questions have been raised about the authenticity of the seized wooden busts, as indeed they have with other items Patterson has dealt with ,. The archaeologists who originally excavated at El Manatí in the late 1980s have expressed genuine surprise that there might be more busts than the ones they recovered . Yet looting and illegal export of artefacts from El Manatí is not impossible. Archaeologist Michael Coe, who believes the busts to be genuine, has stated that he observed a few wooden busts on the antiquities market around 1988, after objects were encountered by locals but before archaeological excavation began . Citing local sources, journalist Julio Aguilar of El Universal has written that an unknown number of wooden sculptures were kept from archaeologists working at El Manatí and were carried to Coatzacoalcos, where they were sold to local dealers . These reports have not been independently confirmed. The seized busts have yet to be scientifically tested to determine if they are genuine and it is unclear if they are among the antiquities seized from Patterson that have been returned to Mexico. Update: Nov 27 2015 On 18 November 2015 a Munich civil court ruled that two wooden figures seized from Patterson which are thought to be looted from El Manatí were illegally exported from Mexico and has ordered their return . Patterson has the ability to appeal this verdict."
"28.txt","Classic Maya city heavily looted in the 1960s and 1970s. The Classic Maya city of El Zotz is located within the San Miguel la Palotada National Park, 20 km west of the major Maya site of Tikal in Guatemala’s northern Petén province. Originally called Pa’Chan, the site was known as Dos Aguadas until 1977 when archaeologist Marco Antonio Bailey registered it as El Zotz with the Guatemalan government. He appears to have changed the name to distinguish it from another ‘Dos Aguadas’ recorded by William Bullard in 1960 . The site is contained within a .75 by .75 km square and is covered by tropical forest. During the Late Classic war between the polities of Tikal and Calakmul, El Zotz appears to have allied itself with Calakmul. This alliance appears to have signalled the end for El Zotz: the last known inscription to refer to the city describes it as being the target of an attack from Tikal . Like most remote jungle sites, El Zotz fell victim to the wave of systematic looting which devastated the Petén in the 1960s and 1970s. Looters even carved their names and the dates of their digging on some of the monuments at the site . It was news of the looting at El Zotz that both inspired Bailey’s visit in December 1977, and brought archaeologists Ian Graham and then George Andrews to the site in 1978 . Almost all of the nearly fifty buildings within the site core have been structurally compromised by looters’ trenches and tunnels. Indeed, by 1983 when archaeologists with the Proyecto Nacional Tikal visited the site to assess looting damage, all buildings of notable size or importance had been looted . Archaeologist Stephen Houston has recorded more than 89 individual looters’ trenches at the site, some of which pass completely through entire pyramids .This looting activity has seriously destabilised the site’s monumental structures. Beyond the expected damage due to looters tunnels, some of the structures have suffered from the removal of carved architectural elements. Some buildings at El Zotz once boasted carved lintels: decorative bars that served as structural elements within temple doorways. The removal of these lintels for sale on the art market can lead to a building collapse. In 1989 a Guatemalan archaeological team with the Proyecto Nacional Tikal was forced to undertake major stabilisation works on Temple 1 at El Zotz related to the removal of lintels by looters. The team installed new lintels in an effort to keep the building standing, and were forced to seal off some of the more unstable rooms and areas of the structure . A wooden lintel, looted from the site sometime in the late 1960s or 1970s and returned to Guatemala from the Denver Museum of Art in 1998, originally came from Temple 1. Epigraphic research may be able to connect a number of unprovenienced vessels in private collections to the looting of El Zotz. Stephen Houston notes that the rulers of El Zotz all used a single name composed of the symbol for ‘great’, a fish, and an animal head . On an unprovenienced vase associated with El Zotz , the name ‘a-ku’ or turtle is added to this formulation and this variation of the El Zotz ruler name connects about a dozen vases in private collections. Two examples that Houston offers are a vase owned by the Mint Museum of Art in Charlotte, North Carolina and another owned by the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University . These vessels are all stylistically and iconographically similar and Houston believes that they will eventually be linked conclusively to El Zotz, perhaps with the aid of scientific analysis if they are ever made available for study ."
"29.txt","Classic Maya carved wooden lintel looted from the site of El Zotz, Guatemala, in the late 1960s and repatriated from the collection of the Denver Art Museum in 1998. El Zotz Lintel 1 is a carved wooden doorway lintel composed of five sopadilla wood planks forming a panel that is 180 cm by 74 cm. It is stylistically dated to between 550 and 650 AD and depicts a standing male figure who is carrying a diagonal ceremonial bar and holding an upright decorated staff . The lintel would have been an important structural element of Structure M7-1 , a 22.5-metre-high pyramid in the East Group of the Classic Maya site of El Zotz. The lintel would have spanned a doorway making it a decorative element that would have helped to bear the weight of the stone building. The El Zotz lintel was removed from Temple 1 by looters who significantly damaged the piece by hacking away the back of it with a hatchet to reduce its weight . It was then trafficked into the United States. The lintel surfaced in the gallery of New York-based dealer Edward Merrin sometime in the early 1970s. According to information collected by New York Times reporter William Grimes , Merrin then sold the piece to the law firm of Berry & Stark Associates which was based in Denver Colorado. In 1973 the firm donated the lintel to the Denver Art Museum. Merrin told Grimes that he did not remember selling the lintel but did not rule out that he did . This seems unusual, since preserved Maya carved wooden lintels are extremely rare and memorable: El Zotz Lintel 1 is one of only about five known examples of this type artefact. Working from the wood fragments that he recorded in situ in 1978, Ian Graham was able to positively link the lintel held by the Denver Art Museum to the lintel missing from Temple 1 at El Zotz . Based on this connection and a review of their own records regarding the acquisition of the piece, the Denver Art Museum voluntarily repatriated the lintel to Guatemala in 1998 with museum representatives stating that ‘returning it was simply the right thing to do’ . The piece is now in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología e Etnología in Guatemala City. There is some debate about when exactly the lintel was looted from El Zotz. Juan Pedro Laporte of the Proyecto Nacional Tikal reports that the lintel was likely removed from Temple 1 between 1966 and 1968 . Stephen D. Houston of the Proyecto Arqueológico El Zotz places the looting of the lintel to 1975, basing his date on Ian Graham’s 1978 observations at the site . Laporte’s date for the removal appears more plausible in light of the 1973 acquisition of the piece by the Denver Art Museum . The inscriptions on the lintel are helpful for understanding the socio-political sphere that El Zotz operated within. Epigrapher David Stuart has noted that one of the emblem glyphs (essentially, glyphs that were used to identify a particular Classic Maya polity; the ‘name’ of the site in a sense) on the El Zotz lintel also serve to identify a particular dynasty at the site of Yaxchilán in Chiapas, Mexico . This may be a coincidence, but it is possible that either the ruling dynasty of Yaxchilán had its origins at El Zotz or that the glyph may indicate that El Zotz was a component of a wider zone that was identified by this emblem . This information would not be known if the provenience of the lintel had not been established. It is unclear what information has been lost from inscriptions that may have been erased from the portion of the piece that was damaged during the looting event."
"3.txt","The Aubin Tonalamatl is a Nahuatl codex which consists of eighteen screen-folded pages on maguey bark paper. It is constructed out of thirteen bark pieces that were pasted together, and it is meant to be read from right to left . It contains the 260 symbols that represent the tonalpohualli, or the count of days. The codex would originally have been 20 pages long, but the first two pages have been lost. The pages are painted on one side and the contents relate to divination, recording the omens associated with particular days . It seems to have originated in the Mexican state of Tlaxcala, based on where it was collected . The Aubin Tonalamatl first appears as ‘kalendario ydolatrico’ in the inventory of a collection of ancient Mexican manuscripts that were owned by Italian aristocrat Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci . The inventory was created as a result of the confiscation of the manuscripts after Benaduci was expelled from New Spain in 1743, and at that point the codex passed into the hands of the local colonial government that sold the document on . A portion of the codex seems to have been sold in or after 1802 from the estate of Mexican astronomer Antonio de León y Gama to two travelling artists: Carl Nebel and Jean-Frédéric Waldek. It is possible that Nebel purchased the codex then sold it on to Waldek. Waldek sold the codex to Joseph Marius Alexis Aubin in Paris in 1841. Aubin eventually obtained pages 3 through 8 of the codex, but it is unclear when and under what circumstances. The complete document was purchased by Charles Eugène Espidon Goupil in 1889 along with 383 other Mesoamerican manuscripts from the Aubin collection. The Aubin Tonalamatl was then donated to the Bibliothèque Nationale de Paris by Goupil’s widow in 1898 . In 1982 a 36-year-old Mexican attorney and journalist named José Luis Castañeda del Valle stole the Aubin Tonalamatl from the Bibliothèque National. Castañeda carried the codex to Mexico and eventually donated it to the Biblioteca del Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia. According to contemporary reports in El País , in June 1982 Castañeda presented himself to the Bibliothèque Nationale as a student and requested to see the Aubin Tonalamatl. The head of the library initially refused his request but, as Castañeda provided all necessary documents and an address, he was granted access to the manuscript. Once left alone, Castañeda put the codex under his jacket, retrieved his authorised reader card, and walked out of the library. Shortly after the theft, France formally requested that the codex be returned from Mexico. Castañeda had provided the Bibliothèque Nationale his real address when he registered as a reader and he was arrested at his residence in Cancus, Mexico in August 1982 . Castañeda instantly admitted the theft, claiming that he had rescued Mexico’s cultural heritage from Europe in an act of nationalism . According to his attorney, Castañeda had become upset by the idea of Mexican manuscripts being housed in European collections while writing various articles on Mexico’s ancient past. Castañeda stated ‘I had the idea to start a nationalist movement for the recovery of codices’, and that the theft in Paris was the first ‘recovery’ of this movement. The Mexican press covered the theft as an act of nationalistic heroism, going as far as to thank him for it . Although initially detained for the theft, Castañeda was released by order of the Mexican Attorney General’s office . The Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores de Mexico claimed that the Aubin Tonalamatl was stolen from Mexico in the 19th century and therefore declined to return it. Castañeda himself, writing to then President Carlos Salinas, justified his action under Mexican law: Based on the eighth article of the General Constitution of the Republic, the Mexican Codex, improperly called the Tonalamatl of Aubin, should be ratified as an archaeological monument, in accordance with the Federal Law of Monuments and Archaeological Areas in effect…[2] . After much discussion, it was decided that the Aubin Tonalamatl would stay in Mexico in an agreement that had to be revisited every three years . As of 2009 the INAH and the Bibliothèque Nationale were working out an agreement that would allow Mexico to keep the Aubin Tonalamatl on permanent loan."
"30.txt","Figurines stolen from Tomb of Empress Dou returned to China by Sotheby’s in 2003. In April 2001, two people from Baqiao District, Xi’an Prefecture employed five farmers to break into the tomb of the Western Han Empress Dou , which is located in the eastern suburbs of the city of Xi’an, itself in Shaanxi Province. They blasted their way into the tomb with dynamite and then resorted to shovels, but the noise attracted the attention of the local police, who arrived and arrested three people, with the rest escaping . The 35-metres-deep shaft leading to the tomb was not filled in, however, and in October 2001 another gang visited the tomb, this one from Qishan County, Baoji Prefecture in Shaanxi Province. On their first visit, the members of this gang took away four grey ceramic figurines, which they later sold for a reported 4,600 yuan each . Over the next few days, they stole a further 200 ceramic figurines, which netted them approximately 4600 yuan . During a later visit in December 2001, the same gang stole 71 colour painted figurines . By February 2002, however, police had made several more arrests, and disrupted the Qishan and other gangs working at the tomb. The police discovered that some figurines had been transported to Hong Kong hidden inside a truckload of new pottery , while others were recovered in Guangzhou . Many of the Hong Kong pieces were also returned to Xi’an. The grey coloured figurines are unusual, and in March 2002 a Chinese police officer recognized six of them for sale as lot 32 in Sotheby’s New York Fine Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art catalogue. The Chinese Embassy in Washington DC contacted staff at Sotheby’s, who withdrew the pieces from sale. US Customs then arranged for their return to China in July 2003 ."
"31.txt","The Euphronios (Sarpedon) krater is a red-figure calyx krater made in Athens circa 515 BC, signed by Euxitheos as potter and Euphronios as painter. It was bought by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1972 for the then record-breaking price of $1 million, and is now thought to have been excavated illegally in Italy in 1971. In 2006, the Metropolitan restored ownership of the krater to Italy. The Euphronios (Sarpedon) krater is a red-figure calyx krater made in Athens circa 515 BC, 46 cm high and 55 cm in diameter, signed by Euxitheos as potter and Euphronios as painter. It is decorated on the front with a scene depicting the death of Sarpedon, who is attended by Hypnos and Thanatos with the god Hermes looking on. On the reverse are three Athenian youths arming themselves for battle. It was bought by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1972 for the then record-breaking price of $1 million, and is thought to have been excavated illegally in Italy in 1971. The Metropolitan’s director at the time, Thomas Hoving, described it as ‘ … a work that would force the history of Greek art to be rewritten’ . In 2006, the Metropolitan restored ownership of the krater to Italy. The find spot and early provenance of the Euphronios krater have never been firmly established. However, the krater is generally believed to have been discovered in December 1971 by tombaroli digging illegally on private land in the Greppe Sant’Angelo area of the Etruscan cemetery of Cerveteri . The tombaroli are said to have sold the krater to Giacomo Medici for something in the region of $88,000, with Medici, in turn, arranging for the krater to be smuggled into Switzerland, where he sold it to Robert Hecht for $350,000 . By this time, the krater was in a fragmentary though completely restorable state, so Hecht left it with Fritz Bürki in Zurich for restoration. The provenance of the krater after its arrival in Zurich is well-documented. In February 1972, Hecht alerted the Metropolitan Museum to the existence of the krater with a letter to Dietrich von Bothmer, the Metropolitan’s Curator of Greek and Roman Art. In June 1972, von Bothmer, along with Hoving and Hoving’s deputy Theodore Rousseau, visited Zurich to view the krater . In August 1972, after some haggling, the Metropolitan agreed to buy the krater from Hecht for $1 million . The money was raised through the sale of the Durkee and Ward collections of 11,000 coins and medals which had been donated to the Metropolitan in the early twentieth century. Sotheby’s agreed to handle the coin sale and offered the Metropolitan a $1.5 million payment in advance, plus 84 percent of all gross receipts in excess of $1 million . The Metropolitan ultimately received nearly $2.3 million from the coin auctions . The krater arrived in the US on 31 August 1972. Hecht claimed to be acting on ten percent commission as agent for the krater’s owner, whom he identified as Lebanese collector and dealer Dikran Sarrafian . Hecht supplied two documents of provenance for the acquisitions committee meeting that approved the purchase. First was a letter dated 10 July 1971, written by Sarrafian to Hecht, in which Sarrafian declared that he would deliver the vase to Hecht in expectation of a final sale price of $1 million. Second was another letter from Sarrafian to Hecht, dated 9 September 1972, stating that Sarrafian’s father had obtained the krater in 1920 in London and that because it was in fragments it had been sent [to Switzerland] for restoration three years before the writing of the letter . On 12 November 1972, the New York Times announced the krater’s acquisition with a cover story for its Sunday magazine . The price and provenance of the krater were both withheld, with the Metropolitan claiming that it was maintaining secrecy in order to protect a potential source of future acquisitions . On 19 February 1973, however, a more critical account of the krater’s provenance was published , heralding a series of articles that questioned the museum’s account and suggesting instead that the krater had been excavated illegally at Cerveteri in late 1971. The names of Hecht and Sarrafian leaked out and the $1 million price tag was revealed . It was during this time in a TV interview that Hoving referred to the krater as the ‘hot pot’—a name that stuck . The new and potentially damaging allegations of illicit provenance caused the Metropolitan to send lawyers to visit Sarrafian in Beirut . They obtained documents from Sarrafian confirming that he had received payment for the krater of $909,000 in Swiss francs on 25 October 1971. They also obtained testimony from a clerk who had seen the vessel in fragments with Sarrafian in Beirut in the early 1960s. The Metropolitan’s legal team also collected affidavits from Bürki, confirming that he had received a fragmentary krater from Sarrafian in August 1971, and a photographer in Basel who had seen the fragments in September 1971 . This evidence was made public in June 1973, and seemed to confirm that the krater was in Switzerland before the suggested December 1971 date of illegal excavation, as well as refute allegations of illicit provenance . In July 1973, Hoving received a copy of a letter that art collector Muriel Newman had sent Sarrafian stating that she had seen a fragmentary Euphronios vessel with him in Beirut in 1964. Newman subsequently signed an affidavit confirming this statement . Thus by the end of 1973, the question of provenance seemed settled in favour of the Hecht/Metropolitan account of Sarrafian’s ownership, and thus legitimate provenance. Hoving has since written, however, that in private, he still harboured doubts. This was largely because, in various statements, Sarrafian had referred to the krater as comprising a hatbox of fragments and implying that it was incomplete . The krater bought by the Metropolitan was complete, and was considered by Hoving to be too large, even in fragments, to have fit into a hatbox. Hoving resigned from the Metropolitan in 1977, but by 1993 he had come to believe that there were in fact two Euphronios kraters: one that had been illegally excavated in 1971 and subsequently acquired by the Metropolitan, and a second less-well-preserved one that had been in the possession of Sarrafian as claimed and documented, but that had subsequently turned up the collection of Bunker Hunt . Hecht had simply taken the provenance and documentation from the Sarrafian/Bunker Hunt krater and attached it to the illegally-excavated and better-preserved Sarpedon krater bought by the Metropolitan. Sarrafian had been killed in a car crash in 1977 , and so was unavailable for further comment. When challenged by Hoving about this switch, Hecht himself was ambivalent . This second krater, however, was bought by Leon Levy and Shelby White in 1990, and returned to Italy in 2010 when evidence emerged that it too had been illegally excavated . If Sarrafian did indeed possess a Euphronios krater, as the evidence collected by the Metropolitan suggests, then its identity and whereabouts remain unknown. Matters rested there until the Italian investigations of Giacomo Medici and Robert Hecht gained momentum though the 1990s and early 2000s. Two photographs were discovered in Medici’s Geneva storerooms, apparently taken in May 1987, one showing Medici standing next to the Euphronios krater on display in the Metropolitan, the second showing Hecht in a similar pose . On 16 February 2001, the Carabinieri raided Hecht’s apartment in Paris. They recovered a handwritten ‘memoir’ of Hecht’s, setting out an autobiographical account of his life in the antiquities trade. It contains two accounts of the Sarpedon Euphronios: the first admitting to the fact that Hecht had bought the krater from Medici and that it had been excavated illegally in 1971; the second reiterating the Sarrafian provenance as provided to the Metropolitan. Finally, in June 2001, Marion True of the J. Paul Getty Museum informed Italian investigators in a sworn deposition that van Bothmer had pointed out to her on an aerial photograph the location of the looted tomb from which the krater was allegedly taken, though von Bothmer subsequently denied this allegation . On 3 February 2006, the Metropolitan reached an agreement with Italy about the return of twenty objects, including the Euphronios krater. Although the evidence for illegal excavation and trade was still largely circumstantial, the Metropolitan’s director Philipe de Montebello clearly thought it was convincing when he was quoted as saying that it was ‘highly probable’ that the vessel had been stolen from an Etruscan tomb . The krater arrived back in Italy on 18 January 2008, where it was put on display with other returned objects at the exhibition Nostoi: Capolavori Ritrovati, before being curated permanently at the Villa Giulia in Rome ."
"32.txt","Also known as: Silver Hoard of Everbeek, & Zilverschat van Everbeek The third-century Roman silver hoard from Everbeek is one of the most high-profile archaeological finds of recent years in Flanders and it has contributed to the political debate surrounding amateur metal detection. Its high profile is due not only to its scientific and financial value, but also to the circumstances of its discovery and curation. Despite apparently being the result of illegal excavation by a metal-detector user, and remaining unreported for at least two years, it was acquired by the Provincial Archaeological Museum at Velzeke. Discovery In December 2010, the Provincial Archaeological Museum in Velzeke announced that it had acquired a Roman hoard of silver artefacts – a unique find in Belgium. Ten silver objects, including four spoons and an ingot, and a golden hair pin had been found together inside a silver bowl decorated with floral and mythological motifs, which itself had been placed upside down inside a ceramic vessel. The assemblage was dated to the second half of the third century AD . The objects were reportedly found in 2008 in a field near the village of Everbeek . The museum’s press release reporting the acquisition was picked up by most national newspapers , and due to the exceptional nature of the find and the circumstances surrounding its discovery it became the centre of a widely-publicised controversy, which was instrumental in putting metal detecting on the political agenda. The find and its acquisition by the Museum of Velzeke sparked a controversy in Flemish archaeology for several reasons. First, the details of the discovery were not disclosed for at least two years. According to Flemish legislation, incidental finds that may ‘reasonably be assumed’ to have archaeological value must be reported to the authorities within three days of their discovery . The finder had first offered the hoard to the Provincial Gallo-Roman Museum in Tongeren in 2008. The latter in turn referred the finder to the museum in Velzeke, which was also notified directly. All parties involved had evidently been aware of the archaeological importance of the find for quite some time, but a formal report was only filed on 21 December 2010 following an express request by the Flanders Heritage Agency, which was alerted by the Museum’s press announcement. As a result, the opportunity to follow up on the hoard find with further archaeological fieldwork had long passed . A second cause of controversy was the unclear circumstances surrounding the hoard’s discovery. Despite the finder’s initial declaration that he had come across the artefacts by chance , there were strong suspicions to the contrary from the start , which occasioned a parliamentary question a few weeks after the museum’s original announcement . Only much later was it confirmed that the find had indeed been the result of systematic metal detection . In addition, the finder admitted that he had continued digging after the initial discovery . Any archaeological excavation in Flanders requires a government-issued permit, for which only qualified and experienced archaeologists are eligible . Unauthorized archaeological metal detection by amateurs is explicitly prohibited . Thus, if the facts as related in the publications referenced here are true, then it would appear to have been an illegal excavation. In the ensuing political debate about amateur metal detecting, which also featured in the press , the Minister responsible for archaeological heritage acknowledged this fact. However, he also stated that no procès-verbal[2] had been drawn up due to the vague nature of the available information and the lack of evidence for the use of a metal detector . Finally, the museum was criticized for its decision to acquire objects of illegal provenance, even though its stated intention was to prevent the hoard from disappearing into a private collection . The museum paid ‘a reasonable price’ of €3000, 10 per cent of the estimated value, to both landowner and finder . This arrangement, though certainly testament to the integrity of the finder, is problematic because it implies that the find was accidental. In fact this was not the case, and therefore, from a legal viewpoint, only the landowner was entitled to payment. Following another, similar case of an exceptional archaeological find in which the use of a metal detector was suspected , the Flanders Heritage Agency’s alleged policy of tolerance towards amateur metal detection was questioned in a Parliamentary Commission on heritage. The minister denied the formal existence of such a policy, but pointed out that active prosecution of metal detectorists reporting finds would be a counterproductive measure, resulting not in less metal detection but in fewer reported finds . Partly as a result of this case, the recent draft of a new heritage decree would lift the ban on archaeological metal detecting by amateurs, instead envisioning the creation of a licensing system for amateur metal-detector users ."
"33.txt","Also known as the Getty Bronze or the Victorious Youth, The Fano Bronze is a bronze statue currently owned by the J. Paul Getty Museum but subject to an Italian claim for repatriation. The statue, dating to 300-100 BC, is of a youth crowning himself with a wreath, presumably soon after winning an athletics contest, probably the Olympic Games . The statue was broken off from its base just above its ankles sometime before discovery, and is thought to have been lost at sea when a cargo boat carrying it from Greece to Italy foundered in antiquity. The statue was discovered in 1964, caught up in the nets of a fishing boat working out of the port of Fano on the Adriatic coast of Italy. Upon the boat’s return to Fano, the crew sold the statue for 3.5 million lira, about USD $4,000 at the time, to local antiquities dealer Giacomo Barbetti . Barbetti hid the statue in a church in Gubbio with the help of a priest named Giovanni Nagni. Sometime later, the statue was smuggled out of Italy, possibly to Brazil, and then bought in London for $700,000 by a Luxembourg-based consortium called Artemis, headed by German antiquities dealer Heinz Herzer, who moved it to Munich for conservation . In 1972, Herzer brought the statue to the attention of Bernard Ashmole, who was Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities at the British Museum at the time, and Ashmole in turn approached J. Paul Getty about a possible purchase . Getty explored a purchase and acquisition deal with the Metropolitan Museum, but lost interest in 1974 when he learned of an Italian police investigation into the piece . Getty died in 1976, and in 1977 the J. Paul Getty Museum bought the statue for $3.95 million . In 1966, Barbetti and Nagni were charged and convicted with theft of Italian state property, though the convictions were quashed in 1968 when an appeals court judged that there was no evidence to suggest that the statue had been found in Italian territorial waters . In 2006, the statue was included on a list of artefacts claimed by Italy for return on the grounds that they had been stolen and smuggled out of Italy. Although the Getty agreed to return 26 objects, it refused to return the statue, arguing that it had been found in international waters and acquired by the Getty only after the Italian appeals court in 1968 had determined that it was not state property . An Italian judge’s call for its seizure and return in 2010 was similarly rebuffed ."
"34.txt","A First Nations totem pole which was removed from Canada under controversial circumstances and eventually repatriated from Sweden. It is the first Canadian totem pole repatriated from Europe. The Haisla are a Canadian Indigenous group based out of the Kitimaat area of the North Coast of British Columbia with an approximate membership of 1500 people (Haisla First Nation ). The modern Haisla First Nation is an amalgamation of two groups which came together in 1947: the Douglas and Devastation Channel Kitamaat (who call themselves Haisla) and the Kitlope (who call themselves Henaksiala) of the upper Princess Royal Channel and Gardner Canal . According to their website, “the Haisla social system is based on matrilineal clans. Eight clans (Eagle, Beaver, Crow, Killer Whale, Wolf, Frog, Raven, and Salmon) make up the community, with each clan having its own chief, its own resources areas, and its own winter village” (Haisla First Nation ). The 1918 influenza pandemic killed the entire Wolf and Frog clans and decimated the population, leaving less than 300 Haisla alive . This massive population drop, which followed numerous other epidemics due to European contact, had a profound effect on the Haisla, disrupting their traditional protection of cultural objects. The Totem Pole In 1872, the leader of the Eagle Clan, Chief G’psgolox, commissioned the carving of a totem pole to honor an experience he had with the spirit Tsooda following the death of his children from smallpox . Carved by two members of the Raven clan, Humdzeed (Johnny Paul) and Wakas (Solomon Robertson), the pole was erected in Misk’usa, a Henaksiala village, where it stood for over 50 years . In Henaksiala culture, totem poles were tied to a complex system of wealth display: part of the prestige and status system associated with the potlach. A potlach was the traditional way to celebrate the erection of a pole . A flowering of totem pole carving occurred due to the initial shift in local wealth following early 19th century European contact, but carving slowed mid-century due to massive population loss from disease . Carving was further curtailed in 1884 when the Canadian government outlawed the potlach and, in 1894, began the mandatory removal of Indigenous children to “residential schools” preventing traditional arts from being taught to younger generations . Removing the Pole In December of 1927 the Swedish vice consul to British Columbia, Olof Hansson, began the process of bagging the G’psgolox totem pole for Sweden’s Museum of Ethnography . Hansson was notified about the location of the pole by an indigenous agent . The vice consul contacted the Canadian Department of Indian Affairs to ask for the pole and they granted his request a month later, stating that because the location where the pole stood was “uninhabited”, the piece was Sweden’s provided that Hansson could convince the Henaksiala to part with it . Both researchers and the modern Haisla have challenged the assertion that the site was abandoned. The Henaksiala moved through a series of locations throughout the year due to seasonal food availability and were likely not in Misk’usa for that reason. This is confirmed by reports that the Henaksiala discovered the pole was missing when they returned to Misk’usa to fish . The stipulation from the Canadian government that Hansson obtain permission from the pole’s owners before removal is a matter of controversy. Hansson claimed in the contemporary Swedish press that although he was able to convince younger Henaksiala to sell him the totem pole, older Henaksiala had resisted . Representatives of the Museum of Ethnography have claimed that the sale of the pole was properly negotiated, however they have no receipt for the purchase nor do they have any record of the terms of the sale, only a Canadian export license . Louisa Smith, the great-great grand daughter of Chief G’psgolox, maintains that the pole was taken without the permission of her family . All of this put the removal of the pole in a precarious legal position. Although the ability of the Canadian Department of Indian Affairs to determine that the pole could even be removed in the first place is ethically questionable, if Hansson did not obtain proper permission from the pole’s rightful owners to remove the piece, his export license would have been obtained based on a false declaration and could, potentially, be challenged in court. Return of the Pole For over 60 years the Haisla did not know the location of the totem pole, however its memory was preserved via oral traditions . In 1991 the pole was found to be in the collection of the Museum of Ethnography in Stockholm and various Haisla confirmed this identification. In December 1991, with logistical help from Greenpeace, several Haisla visited Stockholm not to ask if the pole would be returned, but when . The next year a representative of the museum visited the Haisla who insisted that they believed the museum (but not Hansson) acquired the pole in good faith, but that it was stolen and need to be returned. They offered to make a replica of the pole for Sweden . In 1994 permission was granted for Sweden to “gift” the pole to the Haisla. The implications of this wording, however, caused serious issues, with the Haisla maintaining that you cannot gift someone their own stolen property, and that it is not a true gift if they were required to pay for it with a replacement pole . Negotiations continued and a group of Haisla traveled to Sweden again in 1997 where the Haisla claim that they were told that the museum wanted the piece to be preserved in a climate controlled environment, not displayed outside in the traditional way with the expectation that the pole would return to the earth. The Haisla felt that this was financially impossible , having been given no money to display the pole by either the Swedish or Canadian governments, and that it was a challenge to their traditional cultural practices . The museum eventually stepped down from this stipulation. In 2000 Henry Robertson, the grandson of one of the original pole carvers, made two replica poles, one of which was sent to Sweden in a partially complete state. He then spent a month completing the pole in the museum so that visitors could see the carving process. At this point, the Haisla had not been able to raise the money needed to build a facility for the real pole which remained in Sweden. In 2006 the Haisla conducted a traditional pole raising ceremony for the replica pole at the Museum of Ethnography and on 23 March the original pole was packed and shipped back to Canada. On 1 July it returned to Kitimaat Village and is thought to be the first First Nations totem pole repatriated from Europe ."
"35.txt","Sometime before 1987 a large and elaborately decorated sarcophagus was located by looters near ancient Docemia. They re-buried it for a time in western Turkey before it could be smuggled out of the country . The 2 meter by 1 meter by 1.5 meter, 4 metric ton marble sarcophagus was crafted in AD 180 and has been referred to as a “garland sarcophagus” due to its decorative motif of puttis/cherubs holding a garland that is looped around the outside of the sarcophagus. The Garland Sarcophagus The exact smuggling route of the sarcophagus is unclear. Turkish journalists Melik Kaylen and Özgen Acar working in 1990 were able to connect the piece to an antiquities smuggler and dealer in Munich named Edip Telli who was later sentenced to ten years in prison in Turkey for antiquities-related crimes , but were unable to find out how the piece left Turkey . The sarcophagus was then sold on to Damon Mezzacappa, a principal at Lazard Freres investment bank, for $1 million USD . In 1987 Mezzacappa lent it to the Brooklyn Museum where it was displayed in the Greek, Roman and Coptic Hall. The appearance of the garland sarcophagus in a high-profile museum garnered the attention of Turkish antiquities experts and reporters because a very similar sarcophagus with comparable motifs was on display in a museum in Antalya . The similarities between the two pieces seemed to indicate that they came from the same location, strongly suggesting that the one in the US had been looted and trafficked. Turkey threatened legal proceedings against Mezzacappa if he did not return it. Facing mounting pressure from Turkey, Mezzacappa attempted to donate the sarcophagus to the Brooklyn Museum, hoping for a tax deduction . Although the museum considered the offer, Thomas Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, stated that the Brooklyn Museum ultimately refused the sarcophagus when ”the lid of the sarcophagus was removed at one point and inside were a bunch of Turkish newspapers – and not dating to the 2nd century AD either” . While this story is likely apocryphal the Brooklyn Museum did issue a statement saying that they had turned down the donation of the sarcophagus “because the museum was unable to determine the object’s provenance and its detailed history” . Still under Turkish pressure, Mezzacappa, donated the piece to the American-Turkish Society which, in turn, sent the sarcophagus to Turkey on what they called “permanent loan”. For the donation, Mezzacappa allegedly “was able to deduct $11m from his US tax bill”, despite official valuations of the piece being much lower than that figure . The sarcophagus was displayed at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum for six months before being sent to Antalya for permanent display near its ‘twin’ ."
"36.txt","A Hopewell burial mound located on private property in Indiana that was illegally looted by road construction workers in 1988 and 1989. The so-called ‘GE Mound’ is part of the Mount Vernon archaeological site in Black Township, Posey County, Indiana. It is located near the entrance of a former General Electric plastics plant (now operated by Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corporation) on private property belonging to the plant. The GE mound dates to approximately the first century AD and, at around 400 feet long, 175 feet wide and 20 feet high, was one of the five largest Hopewell mounds ever constructed . At least two intact individuals were interred in the mound along with a number of cremations. Although clearly used for funerary purposes, mounds such as the GE Mound would have served a number of ceremonial functions within Hopewell society . Looting of the Mound In 1988 an initial archaeological survey was conducted at the Mount Vernon site in advance of a federally funded road building project being undertaken by Boyd Brothers construction company . Shovel test pitting produced no significant archaeological deposits, but the consulting archaeologist warned that if any artefacts were found during the course of the construction project, they must be reported to state authorities as per the federal building contract . The subsequent borrowing of soil from the GE Mound by road workers revealed the presence of significant archaeological remains. These remains were neither reported to state authorities nor to General Electric (the landowner) and for three months starting in June 1988, the GE Mound was heavily looted . An anonymous tip to law enforcement concerning a possible violation of state law led to a formal investigation into the looting in late 1988 and 1989. Archaeologist Curtis Tomak was able to confirm that the site had been looted with the aid of heavy machinery . General Electric quickly moved to secure the site from further looting and pledged their full support in any ensuing investigation and prosecution. It was immediately clear that the looting related to the nearby road construction, but it was not clear what state and federal laws had been violated. Questions of Jurisdiction and Applicable Law In the lead up to arresting and charging those responsible for looting the GE Mound, several factors had to be considered. A complicated web of both state and federal legislation may or may not apply in any given context or jurisdiction in the United States, a situation that has been partially clarified by subsequent legislation. First and foremost at the time, the GE Mound was on private property and the owners of that property (General Electric) did not grant permission either for digging to occur at the site or for archaeological objects to be removed. Thus any act of digging at the GE Mound beyond that which was approved in the road construction contract was a clear case of trespass and vandalism under Indiana state law. This would be a state-level criminal charge. Second, if any of the artefacts from the GE Mound had been transported across state lines, the act could possibly be considered a violation of the interstate commerce provision of the 1979 Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA). Section 6, part C of the act states: No person may sell, purchase, exchange, transport, receive, or offer to sell, purchase, or exchange, in interstate of foreign commerce, any archaeological resource excavated, removed, sold, purchased, exchanged, transported, or received in violation of any provision, rule, regulation, ordinance, or permit in effect under State or local law . In other words, since objects were looted from the GE Mound in violation of state law (see above), they could not be legally transported to another state. To do so would be a federal offence. Arrests, Charges, and Penalties The first person arrested in conjunction with the looting of the GE Mound was an Indiana resident named Kirby Wilson. Wilson was charged with trespass, but no evidence was found that he had transported artefacts across state lines . Wilson agreed to cooperate with state authorities and the FBI to avoid criminal charges, an act which resulted in the return of a number of artefacts. The US Attorney’s office successfully convicted five men of violating the interstate commerce provision of ARPA in relation to the looting of the GE Mound. The following information comes from Munson et al. : 1. John William Way: an artefact collector and machinery operator, Way was the first to discover artefacts in the GE Mound while participating in federally funded road work. He carried artefacts from the site across state lines to his residence in Illinois and subsequently sold several pieces to Arthur J. Gerber. In March 1991, Way pled guilty to a misdemeanour charge under ARPA in exchange for his cooperation in subsequent investigations. He was sentenced to thirty days work release, two years probation, and was forced to pay a $2,000 fine. 2. John D. Towery and 3. Danny G. Glover: hired by Gerber to loot the GE Mound in exchange for a share of the spoils. They returned several times to the site but were expelled by a GE security guard. They transported artefacts from the GE Mound across state lines to Towery’s home in Kentucky and later sold some of them at an antiquities show. They were indicted in June of 1991 and in December Towery pled guilty to a misdemeanour charge and Glover to a felony charge under ARPA. Towery was sentenced to sixty days work release and two years probation and Glover was sentenced to 180 days work release and two years probation. Fines were waived for both Towery and Glover due to their inability to pay. 4. Arthur J. Gerber: a photographer and antiquities dealer was indicted in July 1991. He had previously pled guilty to criminal trespass charges related to the looting of an Archaic shell mound site in Indiana called Crib Mound. Gerber pled guilty to several counts of purchasing and transporting unlawfully removed artefacts and unlawful commercial sale. He admitted to several facts outlined in charges of conspiracy, ranging from knowingly trespassing on GE property to attempting to persuade others to not cooperate with law enforcement. Gerber was sentenced to twelve months in prison, supervised release for three years during which time he was unable to participate in activities involving the procurement or sale of artefacts, and was forced to pay a $5,000 fine. The sentence was stayed as he appealed his conviction. In July 1993 the US Court of Appeals upheld Gerber’s conviction. Gerber then appealed this decision to the US Supreme Court which denied his petition in January 1994. 5. Randall R. Hanson: a businessman and artefact collector who dug at the GE Mound on several occasions. Hanson initially offered Way money or drugs for GE Mound artefacts and later offered other looters money, guns, knives, and other items in exchange for artefacts. He transported GE Mound artefacts into Kentucky. In July 1992 Hanson pled guilty to four misdemeanour counts under ARPA and was sentenced to four months of home detention, two years probation, and was forced to pay a $5,000 fine. Archaeological Damage and Information Loss In assessing the damage to the archaeological record caused by the looting of the GE Mound, it is worth looking into the work of archaeologist Mark Seeman who served as an expert witness during the investigation. Seeman records that the more than 3,000 GE Mound artefacts recovered by the FBI were valuable and impressive . They included numerous copper and silver body adornments, copper and stone tools, and even three copper pan pipes, among other items. Yet the true value of the site lay in the exceptional preservation of organic remains. Seeman discovered that the looters had encountered, and in many cases destroyed, fabric, leather, reed pan pipes, and wooden artefacts: classes of artefact that are exceedingly rare at Hopewell sites . This interesting information about Hopewell material culture has been lost. As a result of the looting of the GE Mound as well as the contemporaneous looting of nearby Slack Farm, Indiana state law was modified to require all people who plan on conducting excavations at archaeological sites to seek approval from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources . Further court cases stemming from this change clarified that the law did, indeed, apply to private as well as public land."
"37.txt","The Getty Aphrodite is a large limestone and marble statue of a female deity, probably Aphrodite, Hera or Demeter, dating from 425–400 BC. It was acquired by the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1988 and returned to Italy in 2007. The Getty Aphrodite is also known as: Cult Statue of a Goddess, and also as the Morgantina Venus The statue is thought to have been excavated illegally in 1977 or 1978 from or close to the ruins of the fifth- to first-century BC town of Morgantina in Sicily, and to have passed through the hands of Sicilian antiquities dealer Orazio di Simone . In March 1986, London dealer Robin Symes bought it for $400,000 from Swiss resident Renzo Canavesi, who provided a statement claiming that it had been in his family’s possession since 1939 . By that time, the statue had been purposefully broken into three parts to facilitate its illegal transport from Italy to Switzerland. Symes sold the statue to the Getty in 1988 for $18 million, saying that it had formerly belonged to a supermarket magnate and collector in Chiasso, Switzerland . In 1988, an Italian investigation into illegal antiquities’ excavation in Sicily was inconclusive as regards the Aphrodite, though testimony obtained from local dealer Giuseppe Mascara suggested that the statue had been discovered at the same time as a group of three marble heads, one of which probably belonged to the statue, and a set of silver vessels (the Morgantina silver) . In 1989 charges were brought against di Simone, who was by that time living in Switzerland, but they were dismissed in 1992 because of lack of evidence . In 2001, Canavesi was found guilty in absentia of receiving stolen property and was sentenced to two-years imprisonment and fined the equivalent of $18 million, though the conviction was thrown out upon appeal because of an expired limitation period . In 1996, Canavesi approached the Getty directly with a view to selling some ‘missing pieces’ of the statue, sending copies of photographs showing the statue in pieces before its cleaning and restoration. In 2006, private investigators hired by the Getty as part of a broader investigation into Getty acquisitions and acquisition practices visited Canavesi and inspected the photographs, which were dated to the early 1980s . In 2006, in view of the evidence assembled during its investigation, the Getty agreed to consider returning the Aphrodite to Italy, and in 2007 convened a seminar of international experts to consider its possible find spot . On 31 July 2007, the Getty included the statue on a list of forty objects to be returned to Italy . The statue arrived back in Italy in December 2010 and in March 2011 it was installed in the museum of Aidone, the modern town closest to the ruins of Morgantina ."
"38.txt","The Getty kouros (youth) is a 2 m high marble statue owned by the J. Paul Getty Museum , appearing to date from sixth-century Greece, though believed by many authorities to be a modern forgery. The kouros was acquired on loan for approval by Getty curator Jiri Frel from Gianfranco Becchina in September 1983. There was no clear find spot for the piece, though it was said to have been in the possession of Swiss resident Jean Lauffenberger since 1930 and came accompanied with a documentary provenance comprising letters written to Lauffenberger as long ago as the early 1950s testifying to his ownership . After inspection by more than thirty experts, and despite reservations about the statue’s proportions and possible stylistic anachronisms, the Getty decided the statue was genuine . A crucial finding was the discovery, based on scientific analysis of the statue’s surface, that the magnesium component of the dolomitic marble (calcium magnesium carbonate) had leached out, a process which it was believed could only have occurred naturally and over a period of centuries . The purchase of the kouros for $9.5 million was approved in January 1985 , and announced publicly in 1987 by the then-curator Marion True . Soon after its acquisition, however, it was denounced as a fake . A subsequent investigation of the letters said to constitute provenance revealed them to be forgeries . Then, in 1990, scholar and antiquities dealer Jeffrey Spier published an article revealing the existence of a fake kouros torso, which resembled in anatomical rendering and proportions the Getty kouros. It had been suggested to Spier that both pieces were fabricated in the early 1980s—products of a Rome workshop and even carved from the same block of marble . It was also established around the same time that magnesium could in fact be removed artificially from dolomitic marble, and that its absence should not be taken as a reliable indication of authenticity . With a discredited provenance, and doubts accumulating over the status of the kouros itself, in 1992 the Getty transported it to Greece where it formed the centrepiece of an international colloquium convened with the intention of deciding once and for all the question of its authenticity. Unfortunately, the nineteen invited experts, including scientists and connoisseurs, were unable to arrive at a consensus decision . In 2012 the kouros was described on the Getty Museum’s website as ‘Greek, about 530 BC, or modern forgery’. Since the Athens colloquium, it has been claimed that the alleged forger Fernando Onore sold the kouros to an intermediary in Calabria, who in turn sold it to Becchina for $100,000 . If the statue is a fake, it is not known whether Becchina was aware of this, though the Getty has never since done business with him ."
"39.txt","Giacomo Medici started dealing in antiquities in Rome during the 1960s . In July 1967, Giacomo Medici was convicted in Italy of receiving looted artefacts, though in the same year he met and became an important supplier of antiquities to US dealer Robert Hecht . In 1968, Medici opened the gallery Antiquaria Romana in Rome and began to explore business opportunities in Switzerland . It is widely believed that in December 1971 he bought the illegally-excavated Euphronios (Sarpedon) krater from tombaroli before transporting it to Switzerland and selling it to Hecht . In 1978, he closed his Rome gallery, and entered into partnership with Geneva resident Christian Boursaud, who started consigning material supplied by Medici for sale at Sotheby’s London . Together, they opened Hydra Gallery in Geneva in 1983 . It has been estimated that throughout the 1980s Medici was the source of more consignments to Sotheby’s London than any other vendor . At any one time, Boursaud might consign anything up to seventy objects, worth together as much as £500,000 . Material would be delivered to Sotheby’s from Geneva by courier . In October 1985, the Hydra Gallery sold fragments of the Onesimos kylix to the J. Paul Getty Museum for $100,000, providing a false provenance by way of the fictitious Zbinden collection, a provenance that was sometimes used for material offered at Sotheby’s . The Getty returned the kylix to Italy in 1999. In 1986, bad publicity surrounding the sale of looted Apulian vases at Sotheby’s London caused Medici and Boursaud to part company, and Medici bought the Geneva-based Editions Services to continue consigning material to Sotheby’s . From 1987 until 1994, he was also consigning material to Sotheby’s through other ‘front companies’, including Mat Securitas, Arts Franc and Tecafin Fiduciaire . He developed a triangulating system of consigning through one company and purchasing the same piece through another company. There were two potentially positive outcomes of this triangulation manoeuvre: first, it artificially created demand, suggesting to potential customers that the market was stronger than it actually was; and second, it was a way of providing illegally-excavated or -exported pieces with a ‘Sotheby’s’ provenance, and, in effect, laundering them . By the late 1980s, Medici had developed commercial relations with other major antiquities dealers including Robin Symes, Frieda Tchacos, Nikolas Koutoulakis, Robert Hecht, and the brothers Ali and Hischam Aboutaam . He was the ultimate source of artefacts that would subsequently be sold through dealers or auction houses to private collectors, including Lawrence and Barbara Fleischman, Maurice Tempelsman, Shelby White and Leon Levy, the Hunt brothers, George Ortiz, and José Luis Várez Fisa , and to museums including the J. Paul Getty, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. In 1995, a Sotheby’s London auction catalogue advertised for sale a sarcophagus recognized by the Carabinieri to have been stolen from the church of San Saba, in Rome. Sotheby’s informed the Carabinieri that it had been consigned by Editions Services . This was around the same time that the ‘organigram’ had been discovered, revealing Medici’s central position in the organisation of the antiquities trade out of Italy , and putting the evidence together, the Carabinieri decided to act. On 13 September 1995, in concert with Swiss police, they raided Medici’s storage space in the Geneva Freeport, which comprised five rooms with a combined area of about 200 sq metres . One room was equipped as a laboratory for cleaning and restoring artefacts, another was fitted out as a showroom, presumably for receiving potential customers . In January 1997, Medici was arrested in Rome , and in July 1997, his Geneva storerooms, which had remained sealed since 1995, were opened again for the process of examination and inventory. The official report of the contents of Medici’s storerooms was submitted in July 1999. The storerooms had been found to contain 3,800 whole or fragmentary objects, more than 4,000 photographs of artefacts, and 35,000 sheets of paper containing information relating to Medici’s business practices and connections. The artefacts were mainly from Italy, but there were also hundreds from Egypt, Syria, Greece and Asia. The Swiss authorities turned over Italian material to Italy, but returned the rest to Medici . The photographs were mainly Polaroids, showing what appeared to be illegally-excavated artefacts, sometimes with several views of the same one, in various stages of restoration. Some artefacts were shown still covered with dirt after their excavation, some fragmentary, and others cleaned and reassembled prior to sale . In 2002, Carabinieri raided Medici’s home in Santa Marinella . Medici was charged with receiving stolen goods, illegal export of goods, and conspiracy to traffic, and his trial in Rome commenced on 4 December 2003. On 12 May 2005, he was found guilty of all charges. The judge declared that Medici had trafficked thousands of artefacts, including the sarcophagus fragment that had started the investigation, and the Euphronios (Sarpedon) krater . He was sentenced to ten years in prison and received a €10 million fine, with the money going to the Italian state in compensation for damage caused to cultural heritage . In July 2009, an appeals court in Rome dismissed the trafficking conviction against him because of the expired limitation period, but reaffirmed the convictions for receiving and conspiracy. His jail sentence was reduced to eight years, but the €10 million fine remained in place . In December 2011, a further appeal failed . The evidence recovered during the investigation into Medici’s business was instrumental in forcing several museums and private collectors to return artefacts to Italy, and triggered further investigations and ultimately the prosecutions of Marion True and Robert Hecht."
"4.txt","Ban Chiang is an archaeological site located on the Khorat plateau of Udon Thani province in north-east Thailand. It was occupied from about 3600 BC to 200 AD. It was first recognized as an archaeological site in 1960, with preliminary excavations conducted by the Thai Fine Arts Department in 1967 and 1972. Since then there have been a number of collaborative excavations and other investigations by the University of Pennsylvania Museum and the Fine Arts Department. Occupants of the modern village of Ban Chiang (founded in the late eighteenth century AD) had long been aware of the archaeological site underneath their houses, but they did not start excavating material for sale until the early 1970s, when reports of the site reached wealthy Bangkok collectors and dealers . The villagers would sink shafts down to the required depth and then tunnel out, looking for the collectable red-on-buff decorated pottery that is found in iron-age burials, dating to the final centuries of the site’s occupation. Looting was at its height between 1970 and 1972, when material was being shipped out through the nearby US airbase at Udon . The local farmers are reported to have used the income derived from selling their finds for medical care and educating their children . Looting declined in the late 1970s, in part because of the presence of official archaeological excavation teams, and in part because of an Thai government decree passed in July 1972 making it illegal to buy, sell or export Ban Chiang pottery (though the site was already protected at the time by Thai antiquities legislation passed in 1961 ), and perhaps also because the most easily accessible graves had by then been exhausted. As a result, digging transferred to other sites in the region with a similar cultural assemblage. In 1982, University of Pennsylvania archaeologist Chester Gorman, who had worked at Ban Chiang, reported that in the previous five years of survey not one site had been discovered intact . He also drew attention to the production of fake pottery in neighboring villages. Made from local materials, these fakes were indistinguishable from original pieces. Some were composites of old and new material . On 28 September 1990, Ban Chiang was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The associated documentation claimed that looting had stopped at the site, but by 2001 it was clear that looting had recommenced at Ban Chiang and at other sites in the area, and that large quantities of material were reaching the United States . In 2008, several dealers and museums in southern California were raided by US federal agents on suspicion of selling and acquiring illegally-exported Ban Chiang pottery."
"40.txt","Gianfranco Becchina is an Italian antiquities dealer who has been convicted in Italy of illegally dealing in antiquities. Becchina started dealing in antiquities from his premises in Basel, Switzerland in the 1970s, and is said to have sold material to major museums including the Ashmolean, the Louvre, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Metropolitan Museum, the Princeton University Art Museum, the Toledo Museum of Art and the J. Paul Getty Museum . It is also claimed that he was a major source of material for collector George Ortiz , and sold material to collectors Leon Levy and Shelby White, the Merrin Gallery in New York, Japanese antiquities dealer Noriyoshi Horiuchi, and ‘fragments’ to Dietrich von Bothmer of the Metropolitan Museum of Art . He had links with fellow dealers Mario Bruno and Elie Borowsky , and sold material through Sotheby’s and Christie’s auction houses in London, sometimes using assumed names, such as Anna Spinello (the married name of his sister) . In 1994, the Carabinieri identified among photographs discovered in the wreckage of Pasqale Camera’s car (who had been under investigation for illegal dealing in antiquities) one of a Paestan red-figure krater attributed to Asteas, which in 1998 was found to be in the J. Paul Getty Museum . The Getty had acquired the piece from Becchina, arousing suspicions that Becchina too might be involved in the illegal trade . Soon after, the Carabinieri recognized his central place on the ‘organigram’, where he was shown as head of a cordata and a major supplier of Robert Hecht, and a receiver of material from Raffaele Monticelli of Taranto, who was sentenced to four years in prison in 2002 . By then, Becchina had moved back to his hometown of Castelvetrano in Sicily, leaving his wife Rosie in Basel to oversee his business there. Despite his absence, in May 2002 the Carabinieri, in collaboration with Swiss police, raided his premises in Basel, which included the gallery Antike Kunst Palladion, two storage facilities inside Basel Freeport, and one storage facility outside the Freeport . A fourth storage facility operated by Becchina was discovered and raided in 2005 . The 2002 raids alone resulted in the recovery of 6,315 artefacts in various stages of restoration, 8,000 photographs of artefacts, and 13,000 documents . In February 2011, Becchina was convicted in Rome of illegally dealing in antiquities. He appealed against the conviction . The J. Paul Getty Museum and the Toledo Museum of Art have both returned material to Italy that was acquired from Becchina and subsequently shown to have been illegally exported. In April 2012, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement returned two ceramic vessels and a marble janiform head seized from Christie’s New York auction house that were associated with the investigation of Becchina . The artefacts had been imported into the United States in violation of a bilateral agreement reached between Italy and the United States in 2001 under the 1983 Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act.

"41.txt","The original Golden Horns of Gallehus, unique Bronze Age artefacts, were stolen and melted down in 1802, causing national uproar in Denmark and even inspiring a famous poem. In 2007, the replicas of the originals were also stolen. The Golden Horns (guldhornene), two spectacular artefacts dating from the 5th Century AD, were discovered in Gallehus, near to Mgeltønder in southern Jutland. Both were found ‘by accident’ by peasants, the first in 1639, and the second in 1734 . They were made of gold, and were decorated with runic inscriptions and animal, human and geometric designs, likely representing ‘scenes from religious rituals, seasonal festivals or myths’ . For years, the first horn was kept in the royal palace , and when the second horn was found, its discovery contributed to a ‘general upsurge of interest in prehistory’ in Denmark, and was one of several finds that contributed to a review of treasure trove law in Denmark . By the time of the beginning of the Nineteenth Century, both horns were key exhibits in the Kunstkammer (Royal Collection) at Christiansborg palace in Copenhagen . On 4 May 1802, the Golden Horns were stolen by a goldsmith named Niels Heidenreich . Apparently, the theft had been possible after the thief had befriended the Kunstkammer keeper and secretly borrowed the key to make a copy of it. He was then able to let himself in and take the horns . The robbery was not made public until 7 May, and the thief had apparently been ‘indiscreet enough to begin selling large quantities of clasps, Indian coins and other fakes manufactured from the gold of the melted down horn’’ . Heidenreich was arrested a year later , and spent almost forty years in prison for his crime . The impact of this loss, seen as a ‘catastrophe’ both then and now , led to the composition of a poem by Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger (also the writer of the Danish national anthem), which mythologised the loss of the horns . The poem and the story of the loss of the horns is still studied in Danish schools , and the Golden Horns themselves have been one of a small number of artefacts and monuments that have come to be used to symbolise Danish national identity and patriotism . Replicas larger than the originals were made of the horns in 1859-60 , with a further set of the correct size made in 1979, based on police reports from 1804 and drawings which also survived from before their destruction . However, several casts that were made of the horns have also been lost, leading to an unavoidable degree of uncertainty regarding the exact appearance of the original horns . Remarkably in 2004, a pair of golden earrings believed to have been made by Heidenreich from the prehistoric gold of the horns were donated to the National Museum of Denmark . These are currently displayed along with both sets of replica horns in the museum in Copenhagen, while another set of earrings made from the original horns are displayed in the Museum at Ringe, on Funen (Fyn) . Even more recently, theft occurred again when early one morning in September 2007 the 1970s replicas were stolen from the Royal Jelling Museum while on temporary exhibition there . On this occasion however, the thieves were caught soon after and the horns were recovered, although one of the horns was damaged by saw marks. A large gold neck ring stolen at the same time had been broken into pieces, some of which are still missing . The impact of the loss of the original Golden Horns has been credited with contributing to the Romantic movement in the North at a time when prehistory generally was becoming significant for nationalism in Denmark . Conversely, it has also been suggested that the nature of the theft in 1802, with the subsequent melting of the horns for their gold content, may hint at why ‘so few of the precious sacred objects have come down to us’ . However, a more lighthearted approach to the loss of the iconic pieces of Danish cultural heritage has recently been adopted by the National Museum, with a downloadable game on the museum’s website available, based on the original theft ()."
"42.txt","The Saenz Codex is a Maya codex of questionable authenticity that appeared on the market in 1971. It is also known as the Grolier Codex. The Grolier Codex (sometimes known as the Saenz Codex) consists of eleven fig bark sheets, stuccoed and painted on one side, that are allegedly from a twenty one page Maya book . The lower portion of all pages is badly water damaged. Eight blank sheets of fig bark paper, all unstuccoed, are associated with the codex. One of these sheets was carbon dated to AD 1230 ± 130 . For some time there was confusion about the whereabouts of the Grolier Codex, but it is currently known to be housed at the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City and is not on public display . Appearance in New York The Grolier Codex gained international attention when it was displayed at the Grolier Club, New York, in an exhibition entitled ‘Ancient Maya Calligraphy’, organised in 1971 by archaeologist Michael Coe . The appearance of the Grolier Codex inspired excitement among archaeologists and epigraphers. The Maya were a literate culture who recorded everything from astronomical observances to dramatic works on accordion shaped books made from the inner bark of the wild fig tree. During the Spanish Conquest, these books were interpreted as “falsehoods of the devil” and were systematically burnt en masse by conquistadors and priests, who then expressed shock that the Maya were traumatised by the destruction . Prior to the appearance of the Grolier Codex, only three Maya codices were known to have survived the Conquest, transported to Europe in the 16th century as curiosities or souvenirs. It had long been thought that the fragile nature of fig bark paper and the wet, acidic soils of Mesoamerica would effectively prevent further codices from being found within archaeological contexts. That the Grolier Codex was said to have come from a dry cave signalled that there was hope that new codices might yet be found in situ, as opposed to in a European library. However, inquiries into both the provenance and provenience of the Grolier Codex produced surprising results. Fantastic Discovery Story Coe was told by an unnamed friend that a Mexican collector named Dr. Josué Saenz[1] had purchased what appeared to be a real Maya codex in 1966. Coe travelled to México City to have a look and was reasonably convinced that the document was not a forgery and asked Saenz how the object came into his possession. Saenz related that an unnamed person told him (perhaps in person, although some accounts state that he received a series of phone calls) that if he was willing to fly to a remote airstrip and not ask any questions, he would shown some recently unearthed Maya treasures. Saenz got in a light plane with two men and, although the plane’s compass was covered with a cloth, he was familiar with the area and stated that they landed on a remote airstrip in the foothills of the Sierra de Chiapas. Saenz was shown the codex and other objects which the looters said were found together in a dry cave, the location of which was not revealed . He was told he could take the objects to Mexico City to have them authenticated before he bought them. Saenz said his expert denounced the items as fakes but that he bought them anyway. Coe obtained permission from Saenz to display the Codex in his upcoming Grolier Club exhibition and it is from this that the document earned its name. Coe reveals little about Dr Saenz, and the story related by Coe in his 1992 volume strikes many as far-fetched. Indeed, Coe had previously been shy about sharing this tale. In his 1973 catalogue of the exhibition that included the Grolier Codex, its owner is listed, inaccurately, as ‘Collection: private collection, New York’ . When contacted by Karl E. Meyer in 1973, Coe would only say that ‘the codex was a “real hot potato” lent to the Grolier Club by an anonymous owner’ and would say no more on the matter . The Grolier Codex was eventually donated to the Mexican Government, although the timing and the circumstances of that donation are unclear.[2] Questions of Authenticiy The fantastical nature of the story offered by Saenz and the document’s unusual iconographic features have caused some scholars to question the authenticity of the Grolier Codex. Over the years, numerous forged Maya codices have appeared on the market, but these have been easily dismissed as fakes based on either the construction of the paper, an apparent lack of knowledge of Maya hieroglyphs, or clear plagiarism from the three surviving codices . Analysis of the Grolier Codex was not so simple: the paper of the Grolier codex appears authentic, the inscriptions are numeric and not textual , and the contents are not lifted directly from any known codices.[3] Maya archaeologist , one of the strongest critics of the Grolier Codex, called attention to a variety of iconographic anachronisms and a curious lack of certain predictive data within the document . Baudez , following Thompson, has argued that the main flaw with the codex is its futility. He argues that Maya codices were used to inform readers about predictive omens associated with various dates. The Grolier Codex, while having sequences related to the movement of Venus, seems to lack both"
"43.txt","HMS Duke of Albany is a military vessel that was sunk during the First World War. It came to rest off the Orkney Islands to the north of mainland Scotland. It is protected under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. After a diver illegally removed a porthole and an oval-shaped metal plate from the wreck in 2010, a successful prosecution was brought against him. HMS Duke of Albany started out as a ferry running between Fleetwood and Belfast (at that time simply known as the Duke of Albany), but in the First World War she was commandeered by the Royal Navy, renamed HMS (Her or His Majesty’s Ship) Duke of Albany, and stationed around the Orkney Islands . In 1916, she was attacked, sank , and the twenty-four sailors on board lost their lives . Hence the site of the wreck, some sixteen miles east of Old Head, South Ronaldsay , is also the ‘final resting place of those who lost their lives in national service’ ; a war grave. It is a Designated Vessel under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, recorded as sinking on 26 August 1916 . In August 2010, divers visited the wreck site and, apparently unaware of the law, one of the party removed two items from it – a porthole and a metal plate – intended as souvenirs of the dive . The Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) detectives first received a complaint from Navy Command, which followed ‘a referral by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency that a group of divers had visited the First World War wreck and illegally removed items from the war grave’ . It was due to the discovery of images posted on Facebook that in September 2011 the MDP were able to visit the suspected diver, Duncan Keates, at his home in Leicestershire, to interview him under caution . In November 2011, Keates, having admitted removing the port hole and metal plate from the protected shipwreck was fined £1,400 at Kirkwall Sheriff Court . The fine was lower than it could have been , apparently due to the defendant’s early admittance of guilt . Several diving websites ran the story at the time, , with British Diver reminding enthusiasts to be aware of the law concerning protected wreck sites and advising them not to risk removing material if they are unsure of the status of the wreck that they are visiting. Defence Policy and Business , part of the UK Ministry of Defence, noted that the assistance of members of the diving community ‘who had legitimately visited the wreck and seen…[the]…items in situ’ was instrumental in building the case against the offending diver (quoting Detective Sergeant Peter Cassidy). The Protection of Military Remains Act 1986 protects from ‘unauthorised interference’ designated aircraft and vessel remains of UK origin that have sunk, crashed, or become stranded while in military service of the UK on or after 4 August 1914, and that rest in UK or international waters. The Act also protects any associated human remains, offering such sites protected war grave status ."
"44.txt","In 1997, following the arrest in Vietnam of two Japanese dealers attempting to illegally export antique ceramics, a license was granted by the Vietnamese government to a commercial salvage company to excavate the Hoi An (Cu Lao Cham) shipwreck. The subsequent auction of finds from the wreck was largely unsuccessful. In 1993–94, the crew of a fishing vessel off the coast of the Hoi An area of Vietnam began to find ceramics in their fishing nets when trawling in a particular spot . The boat’s captain, Captain Trang, reportedly decided to fish exclusively for these pots after an antiques dealer in Hoi An bought his first yield ‘for a good price’ . Before long, other crews had noticed what was happening, and soon there were numerous fishing teams using their nets to harvest saleable pots: ‘Huge dishes, ornate dragon sculptures, and delicate vases were picked out of the nets and sold straight to the dealers’ . Dr Trinh Cao Tuong of the Vietnamese Institute of Archaeology had already notified the Ministry of Culture having noticed sales in Hoi An of ceramics that were similar in style to those found at the Chu Dau pottery on the Red River Delta. However, it was not until two Japanese dealers were stopped at customs at Vietnam’s Da Nang Airport and found to have undeclared antique pottery in their luggage, leading to their arrest for smuggling illicit antiquities, that serious notice was taken by the authorities. The arrest of Japanese citizens was an indicator of international trade, attracting the attention even of the Vietnamese Prime Minister . In addition, pieces from the wreck site had begun to appear in Ho Chi Minh City, Singapore, Tokyo, Hong Kong and London . Excavation and Salvage Discussed in more detail below, much archaeological work on shipwrecks in Southeast Asia tends to be carried out as a partnership activity between archaeologists and commercial salvage companies. In the case of Hoi An, the Malaysian-Chinese businessman Ong Soo Hin, who owned Saga Horizon (a Singapore-based salvage company with experience of both commercial salvage and archaeological excavation in the region) made a proposal to the government for excavation of the Hoi An wreck. He proposed to work with the Vietnamese Salvage Agency (VISAL)—a government-owned salvage company—and to carry out a full archaeological excavation of the vessel ‘in return for the right to sell a proportion of the pottery recovered’, while also providing the government with a full archaeological report . Ong received a license to search for the wreck in 1997 , and recruited Oxford University-based marine archaeologist Mensun Bound to lead the excavation. Bound apparently had misgivings about the connection with a commercial salvage company, but was eventually swayed by Ong’s insistence that there would be likely so many ceramics recovered that there would be nowhere to store them all if they were not sold , and by assurances that no export permit from the Vietnamese Ministry of Culture would be granted for the recovered material until the excavation report had been submitted to the government . Auctioning the Ceramics Some 250,000 pots were salvaged from the wreck , with all unique pieces plus 10 per cent of the ‘repetitive’ pieces kept by Vietnamese museums . The pottery was primarily of Vietnamese blue-and-white ceramics , dating to circa the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century AD or earlier at around 1430–1480 . The agreement that had been made between Saga Horizon and the Vietnamese government was that 30 per cent of the finds would go to the government. In the end, the government made the decision to sell much of their own share alongside those contractually promised to Saga Horizon, reasoning that they were many duplicates, and that they could use the revenue raised to create a museum especially for the remaining Hoi An material. This however reportedly unnerved Ong, who feared that so much material of the same style from the same source on sale at once would flood the market; he was already concerned that too much material had been recovered . Ong originally negotiated a sales strategy with international auction house Sotheby’s, but then made the decision to switch to San Francisco-based Butterfields. This decision perplexed some observers, since the main market for Southeast Asian material was Europe (with the Sotheby’s London auction house well placed to take advantage of this). However, Butterfields had recently been purchased by online auction company eBay, and it is likely that Ong wanted to take advantage of the global reach of an internet auction alongside an on-site sale at the auction house itself . It was also, reported to be the first time that Vietnamese antiquities had been offered for sale through the internet In the event, the auction, which began on 10 October 2000 , attracted buyers representing many of the large museums, including museums in Phoenix, Santa Barbara, Denver, Los Angeles, and Seattle, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, and the British Museum. Some objects sold for above their pre-sale estimates. For example, three dragon ewers, all valued at $30,000–$50,000 USD, sold for $79,500, $63,000 and $57,500 USD; with the latter two selling to the British Museum and the Gallery of New South Wales respectively . However, by the end of third and final day of the San Francisco sale, just 40 per cent of the lots had sold, with the follow-up online sales through eBay reaching similar statistics. Even at the time of writing, a keyword search on eBay revealed material reportedly from the Hoi An wreck for sale at relatively low prices, and Pope noted that Hoi An ceramics frequently appear in mail-order gift catalogues. Following the auction, Bound resolved to spend time on producing a comprehensive report on the wreck, including specific detail about the dating of the material culture . By 2014, a major publication on the vessel from Bound had not yet emerged. Others have noted with surprise that little has been published on the wreck, particularly concerning the vessel itself . Bound did, however, note in his introductory essay to the Butterfields auction, that the boat was likely of Thai origin . Ong had invested almost $14 million USD on the salvage and excavation of the Hoi An wreck, and made only $2,960,000 from the sale . He was said to have left bad debts in both Singapore and Vietnam, moving to Perth, Australia . Hoi An and the South China Sea The port of Hoi An in Qang Nam Province, central Vietnam, close to the Cu Lao Cham Islands, is itself ‘an exceptionally well-preserved example of a South-East Asian trading port dating from the 15th to the 19th century’, and as the only town of this type to have survived intact in the country, was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999 . The town is located on the coast of the South China Sea, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, and from the 1500s to the 1700s it was the busiest port in what is today Vietnam . The trade in ceramics from Southeast Asia has been prolific for centuries, expanding at different times to involve most countries in the region, as well as merchants from places such as Persia, India, and in the sixteenth and seventeeth centuries attracting involvement from the Spanish, Portuguese and Dutch . One by-product of this long period of active trade has been the high occurrence of shipwrecks, with the oldest known to date from around 250 AD . In the past four decades, more than 100 ancient shipwrecks have been discovered in Southeast Asia, with many looted by the time of discovery . Many studies of both trade patterns and also shipbuilding techniques in the region have included reference to the data generated from the discovery of shipwrecks such as Hoi An and Belitung . Study of ceramics from Hoi An have also featured in key research texts on Southeast Asian pottery . The vessel itself has been described as a vessel of the ‘South China Sea Tradition’ . Shipwreck excavation and salvage in Southeast Asia The preamble to the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage 2001 states that UNESCO is ‘[d]eeply concerned by the increasing commercial exploitation of underwater cultural heritage, and in particular by certain activities aimed at the sale, acquisition or barter of underwater cultural heritage’ . The Convention could not come into force until after the date of deposit of the twentieth instrument of ratification, and so was not active until January 2009 . Therefore, although in development, the Convention was not in place at the time of the Hoi An wreck excavation/salvage. Even since its coming into force, Vietnam has not ratified the Convention. Nonetheless, the discussions of the draft convention did raise awareness among national governments, and many Southeast Asian countries tightened their policies concerning commercial salvage, for example by adding a requirement that archaeological excavation and reporting needed to take place (although notably retaining the commercial element) . Pope described some of the techniques used by commercial wreck-hunting vessels to locate potential sites, including instances of the captain: ‘…running his vessel in parallel lines over the search area while towing some sort of detector. A magnetometer is useful for detecting metals at a distance by sensing local distortions in the earth’s magnetic field. Modern ships made of steel show up clearly, but old wooden vessels can also be detected, especially if they sank with cannonry, whose iron can act as a beacon even if buried deep under mud or sand’. Other techniques include use of a side-scan sonar, and, ‘in clear water some wreck-hunters simply tow divers, trusting the human eye to spot anomalies Flecker, who has been active in underwater excavations in Southeast Asia for a number of years, has commented that at present in Southeast Asia, ‘where most wreck-sites are threatened with looting or outright destruction, the priority must be to document those sites and the artefacts recovered from them before too much information is lost… …if commercial transactions are banned outright, the finders will be driven underground, and there will be no hope of archaeological intervention’ . Bound had also apparently felt that the developers of the UNESCO convention had ‘closed their eyes to the realities’ facing vulnerable wrecks in Southeast Asia, reasoning that it was better to work with commercial salvage companies than to do nothing at all . Criticism has been aimed at archaeologists such as Flecker and Bound for working with commercial companies (see Belitung case study for a discussion of this). Flecker also noted that the priority given to excavating and salvaging wrecks with saleable cargo such as ceramics has meant that other ‘fascinating and readily accessible wrecks’ have not been researched due to the more limited scope for profit. This in turn skews the archaeological record by prioritising wrecks which will yield the most benefit for commercial partners."
"45.txt","Peruvian site, the location of a major cemetery of the Wari culture that was heavily looted for textiles in the 1980s and 1990s. The site of Huaca Malena is located approximately 100 km south of Lima in Peru’s Asia Valley. It is associated with the Wari civilization and from about 700 to 1100 AD Huaca Malena was a major Wari provincial cemetery . The site consists of a 4-acre-wide manmade platform which is augmented by six smaller terraces formed from adobe brick. It was discovered by Peruvian archaeologists Julio Tello and Toriba Mejía Xesspe in 1925 and their excavations resulted in the discovery over 300 mummy bundles .The dry desert climate of the region has allowed for the exceptional preservation of textiles at Huaca Malena. According to Angeles and Pozzi : Textiles recovered from Huaca Malena range from tunics of cotton and camelid threads, woven bands, bags, belts, miniature looms, and other fragments. At least 32 techniques have been identified, including very fine tapestry, double cloth, brocade, gauze, warp-faced weaves, tubular weaves, and others. Because of their superior craftsmanship, the Huaca Malena textiles are very desirable on the international antiquities market. As a result, the site has been extensively looted. It is unclear exactly when most of the looting occurred at Huaca Malena. Archaeologist Rommel Angeles Falcon recounts that when he started his archaeological studies in the early 1980s, Huaca Malena was largely intact. By the time he was appointed director of an archaeological project at Huaca Malena in 1997, the site was 65 per cent looted and the entire top terrace had been destroyed . Angeles’ project has recovered about 4,000 textiles fragments, many of which had been discarded by looters on the surface of the mound . Angeles and his colleagues have embarked on a number of initiatives to both preserve the remaining Huaca Malena textiles and educate the public about the information-loss associated with the looting at the site. They founded an ‘Adopt-a-Textile’ program which encourages locals, students, and scholars to become involved in the preservation of the recovered Huaca Malena pieces . In 2001 they opened a local museum and in 2007 the museum organised a protest against looting in honour of the International Museums Day . They have also worked extensively with local school children to promote the value of the Huaca Malena as a site of learning and local history. According to most accounts, looting at Huaca Malena has been slowed significantly because of their efforts."
"46.txt","The strongest claim to ownership of the collection of Late Roman silver known as the Sevso Treasure has been maintained by Hungary. The Hungarian claim on the Sevso Treasure is based on two lines of evidence, the first archaeological, and the second arising out of a police investigation into the 1980 death of Hungarian national József Sümegh. The legal basis of the claim is a 1963 Hungarian law that declares important cultural objects to be State property at the time of their discovery . There is a scholarly opinion that the Sevso or Hunting Plate was made for an important Roman official (Sevso) living in the area of Lake Balaton in western Hungary, perhaps resident or owner of the archaeologically excavated villa at Szabadbattyán . Further albeit circumstantial evidence has been adduced to support the idea that the silver was not only used but also deposited and discovered in the same area. In May 1878, ten pieces of a Roman-period silver folding stand were discovered close to the village of Polgárdi, 16 kilometres east of Lake Balaton, and donated to the Hungarian National Museum. Originally thought to comprise the remains of a folding tripod , in 2002 the pieces were shown to be the surviving parts of a folding, four-legged tetrapod stand . In terms of date, material and decoration, the stand bears comparison to some pieces of the Sevso Treasure, particularly the pair of geometric ewers, and they might all have been manufactured in the same workshop, perhaps one located in the Balkan peninsula . Functionally, the stand complements the Sevso assemblage. It was designed to support silver bowls or plates, such as the Sevso ones, and indeed there are abrasions underneath the rim of the Sevso Meleagus Plate that might attest to the use of a stand . While close affinities of material and decoration and complementarity of function cannot establish direct association, the evidence is nevertheless suggestive. The Treasure and the stand may have been buried at separate locations during the time of a major barbarian incursion in 374 AD, or perhaps later . József Sümegh was found dead in 1980, hanging by the neck from a ceiling beam of a wine cellar, not far from where the remains of the Polgárdi tetrapod had been found . Although his death had been declared suicide in 1980, investigations re-opened in 1990 at the request of Sümegh’s father . After reviewing the evidence and taking new witness statements, the police established that Sümegh had probably been murdered, and began searching for possible motives. Neighbours and friends reported that in 1977 Sümegh had come into possession of a large sum of money, most likely from the sale of two pieces of silver to an antiquities dealer in Budapest. The police came to believe that Sümegh had found the Sevso Treasure in the mid to late 1970s, probably somewhere close to Polgárdi, and had hidden it in the wine cellar, where the police discovered a back-filled hole. After excavation, this hole was shown to conform to the dimensions of the Sevso cauldron, which is believed to have contained the silver . Sometime after the reported sale of the first two pieces of silver in 1977, the police believe that Sümegh returned to the cellar with two unknown people, probably with a view to arranging the sale of more or all of the silver, only for them to murder him and steal it . The Hungarian claim was rejected by the New York State Supreme Court in November 1993 in favour of the Marquess of Northampton who was the then owner of the Treasure, though the Hungarian authorities have since complained that their case was not given a fair hearing. The court disallowed any testimony regarding the Polgárdi stand , and did not admit the results of soil analyses conducted by British experts hired by Croatia, which are said to have matched a small sample of soil taken from the Meleagros Plate to soil in the wine cellar, where Hungarian police believe the Treasure was hidden by Sümegh . Furthermore, the testimony of witnesses called by Hungary in support of the police investigation was discredited . Northampton’s lawyers have since commented that Hungary’s failure to call any of Sümegh’s close family as witnesses was particularly damaging to its case, particularly as they had all sworn to never having seen him with the silver . Since the court case, however, József Sümegh’s younger half-brother Ishtevan has been reported as saying that he does remember József with the Treasure, and helped him clean it . Northampton’s lawyers have discounted this later testimony as conflicting with the earlier sworn statement , though it should be remembered that at the time of his earlier statement, Ishtevan believed his life to be in danger because of what he knew about the silver . Northampton’s lawyers continue to be dismissive of the Hungarian case , and in March 2014 it was announced that Hungary had bought seven pieces of the Treasure for €15 million from a trust in the name Peter Wilson’s two sons. Wilson, who died in 1984, was an ex-chairman of Sotheby’s and had first encouraged Northampton to purchase the silver. It seems that ownership of the Treasure was divided in 2008 between Northampton and Wilson’s sons. ."

"48.txt","In 1972 looters heated this Maya monument and doused it in water, causing it to break into easily-transportable fragments. Ixkun is a Maya site located in the Mopan river valley in Guatemala’s Péten Department, about 6.5 km north of the town of Dolores. Although primarily a Late Classic site, there is evidence that Ixkun was inhabited from the Preclassic into the Postclassic periods. The ruins have been known for some time and were first published in 1852 following a visit by Colonel Modesto Mendez and artist Eusebio Lara . Early interest in the site was perhaps due to the presence of an impressive and massive monument: Stela 1 which is one of the tallest monuments in the Péten . Archaeologist Alfred Maudslay visited and mapped the site in 1887, spending a total of three weeks there . His excavations at Ixkun are considered to be among the first formal archaeological digs within the Maya region . Sylvanus Morley and Herbert Spindon remapped the ruins in 1914, and conducted photographic documentation of known monuments . Ian Graham also remapped the ruins in visits in 1971, 1972, and 1978 . Since 1985 the site has been excavated by the project Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala . The site’s South Causeway, which unites two plazas with a particular building group, is 215 m long, 15 m wide and raised 1.3 m. At the southern end of the plaza is a raised platform which incorporates several monuments including Ixkun Stela 5 . This monument was first recorded by artist Eusebio Lara in 1852 and a pen-and-ink drawing of the monument, probably by Lara, is housed in the library of the Society of Antiquaries of London . Stela 5: Photo by Morley and Graham (composite) via the Peabody Museum The 2.65 m tall Stela 5 was commissioned by a ruler known as Rabbit God K around AD 800 and is made of white limestone. It was carved only on the front and depicted a male figure wearing an elaborate headdress and carrying a staff in one hand while scattering drops of liquid with the other. Beneath the figure were a hieroglyphic panel and a bound and seated war captive . There were also hieroglyphics above the main figure and behind the prisoner. The stela was in good condition when it was discovered . In 1972 the stela was damaged by looters who broke it into numerous pieces. Many of the pieces were stolen. Graham recounts that he returned to the site in 1972 specifically because of reports of the ruining of the stela. He believes that it was damaged less than 3 weeks before his arrival. Based on the evidence he found at the site, Graham believes that the looters built a fire around the monument to heat it and then doused it with cold water to force the piece to break . Upon finding the scattered remains of Stela 5, Graham removed several of the remaining pieces to the village of Dolores . Three of these fragments were later used as road construction material by the municipality . To prevent further misuse of the Stela 5 fragments in Dolores, they were transferred to the custody of the Atlas Arqueológico project in 1989. The project also retrieved a remaining fragment of the stela from the site in 1991 . The known pieces are now kept in the laboratory of the Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala in Dolores. A piece of the stela that shows part of the hair of the captive is now in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología . The whereabouts of the looted fragments are unknown."
"49.txt","On 5 February 1999, the J. Paul Getty Museum returned three artifacts to Italy: Fifth-century BC Attic red-figured kylix, signed by Euphronios as potter and painted by Onesimos with scenes of the Trojan War . The Getty started acquiring fragments of this kylix in the 1980s, paying $180,000 to Frieda Tchacos of Galerie Nefer in Zurich for pieces comprising approximately forty percent of the whole. Tchacos said that she had in turn bought them from Nino Savoca of Munich . Other pieces were obtained from the Schweitzer collection of Arlesheim, a collection which has been reported as having often been used as a false provenance , and from the Geneva Hydra Gallery, under the proprietorship of Christian Boursaud. The Hydra Gallery is now thought to have been acting as a ‘front’ for dealer Giacomo Medici . Boursaud provided as provenance the name of the Zbinden Collection, which is believed to have been invented in an attempt to ‘legitimise’ the piece for acquisition . Another piece was donated by the Metropolitan Museum’s Dietrich von Bothmer in the mid-1980s, which he had obtained from dealer Robert Hecht in 1968 . The kylix was still not complete when it was published in 1991 by Dyfri Williams of the British Museum, who reported that he had seen a photograph of a missing fragment comprising three joining pieces . The original of this photograph was found in the possession of Giacomo Medici when Carabinieri raided his Geneva storerooms in 1995 , and Medici handed over the pieces shown in the photograph in April 1999 once the rest of the kylix had been returned to Italy . The Medici storerooms also contained photographs of the fragments that the Getty did own, showing that they had passed through Medici’s hands, even though he had not sold them directly to the Getty . In the 1997 conference Antichità Senza Provenienza, held at Viterbo University in Italy, the archaeologist Maria Rizzo presented evidence that the kylix had in fact been excavated illegally from the Etruscan cemetery of Cerveteri, and directly addressing Getty curator Marion True, who was attending the conference, asked for its return . After receiving corroborating information from Italy, the Getty complied with her request . The torso of a second-century AD statue of the god Mithra . This piece was bought from an unnamed European dealer in 1982. It was later discovered to be part of a statue that had been stolen from the Italian Giustiniani Collection. It seems that after the theft the statue had been deliberately broken into pieces to facilitate its sale and transport . Second-century AD copy of a head of Diadoumenos by Polykleitos. This piece was acquired by the Getty in 1995 as part of the Fleischman Collection . It was later discovered to have been stolen from the official excavation storeroom at Venosa ."
"5.txt","The archaeological site of Batán Grande, now within the Santuario Histórico Bosque de Pómac, is located in the small coastal valley of La Leche in the Pitipo District of the Lambayeque Province on Peru‘s North Coast, about 41 km from the city of Chiclayo. The site was created by the Lambayeque Culture, a subset of the Sicán Culture. What archaeologists have termed Batán Grande occupies an area of around fifty five square kilometres . Because of the massive area the site covers, it is often discussed in terms of its constituent adobe pyramids, known colloquially as huacas, seventeen of which make up the site . These include Huaca Loro, Huaca Tres Ventanas, and Huaca la Merced. Batán Grande appears to have been a major centre during the Middle Sicán period , a cultural florescence that was aided by the decline of the nearby Wari and Middle Cajamarca cultures. Research indicates that Batán Grande was largely abandoned between 1050 and 1100 AD, the result of thirty years of severe drought and subsequent societal breakdown. ‘A Mecca of Grave Looting’ Izumi Shimada, the foremost authority on the archaeology of Batán Grande who began excavating at the site in 1978, refers to it as ‘a Mecca of grave looting'[1], noting that ‘[t]hese destructive clandestine operations have not only prevented serious fieldwork but also effectively obscured the complexity and significance of archaeological remains’ . During his early work at Batán Grande, Shimada recorded over 20,000 ‘deep pits and numerous bulldozer/land grader tracks from the looting’ which he believes occurred from the 1930s until the 1960s . This, in itself, is an imprecise estimate of the extent of the Batán Grande looting based on aerial photography. Shimada recorded that a single looters’ pit could result in the looting of over half a dozen burials in a technique that employed a series of horizontal tunnels which radiated out from the single central shaft . Shimada has since recorded over 100,000 looters’ pits . Peruvian archaeologist Walter Alva estimated that ninety per cent of Peruvian gold artefacts in international museum collections originated from the looting at Batán Grande . The majority of gold objects in the private Museo Oro del Peru in Lima, which consists of the collection of Peruvian businessman Miguel Mujica Gallo, are alleged to be the result of the Batán Grande looting . Many of these objects have become cultural icons in Peru: they are some of the most familiar images of the country’s ancient past. Shimada notes that because the looted Batán Grande objects that appear on the art market are primarily fine elite goods, a ‘one-sided picture’ of the site has emerged, the unfortunate consequence being that many of the gold artefacts were subsumed under the designation ‘Chimú Culture’ [2]. Such a lumped grouping prevented the accurate study of local artistic, technological, and social development within the greater Middle Sicán period. The Aurich Family Early looting at Batán Grande was tied to the enormous power of Peru’s pre-1968 landed aristocracy . The site was largely owned by the Aurich family who, from before the 1930s until around 1970, employed ‘an organized looting army’ of campesiños, rural peasants, who already bound to them via the hacienda system . Eventually this looting enterprise included heavy machinery resulting in what Alva has called ‘the most extensive pillage in the New World’ . The looting of the huacas at Batán Grande appears to have started in earnest in the early 1900s when the hacienda was owned by Juan José Aurich Pastor . Aurich’s sons, Edmundo and Oswaldo Aurich Bonilla, inherited the hacienda in 1970, but the property was taken from them during Peru’s 1973 agrarian reform. During this period the campeseños that the Auriches once employed gained collective land title to the site, which they continued to loot . After losing their claim to the site, the Aurich brothers were reportedly in financial straits, at least comparatively, and are alleged to have engaged in antiquities dealing and appraisal until at least the late 1990s . The Aurich brothers are linked to another major illicit antiquities case, the looting and recovery of a gold backflap from the site of Sípan. Atwood records that the Aurich brothers were friends of Denis Garcia, the Miami-based intermediary who attempted to sell the backflap to the FBI. Garcia and his wife lived in Chiclayo in the 1960s, during the height of both the Batán Grande looting and the Aurich brothers’ fortunes. Garcia’s wife recalls being shown some of the gold archaeological objects that the Auriches had amassed . Furthermore, Atwood alleges that the Auriches were acquainted with Manual Bacigalupo Remy, the man who is said to have purchased the looted Sipán backflap in 1992 once it was removed from the village of Sipán. Citing a Bacigalupo family friend as a source, Atwood states that Edmundo Aurich advised Bacigalupo during his purchase of the backflap . The looting at Batán Grande did not go unnoticed, even during its earliest phases. Julio Tello, the ‘father of Peruvian archaeology’, inspected the looting at Batán Grande in the 1937 as a representative of the Museo de Arqueología Peruana . Reportedly the Auriches did not allow him onto their property, but Tello was able to conduct preliminary excavations in the area of Huaca La Merced and Huaca Tres Ventanas. This work was detailed in a series of newspaper articles for the Lima-based newspaper El Comercio . Again, due to the power of the hacienda owners at that time, there was little that Tello or other archaeologists could do either to stop the looting or to mandate archaeological intervention on Aurich property. Other Threats to the Site Looting is not the only threat to the integrity of Batán Grande. The area is extremely prone to flooding, especially in El Niño years. In 1983, a flash flood destroyed 80 per cent of one of the huacas and flooding in 1997 undermined the foundations of the Huaca del Oro . The El Niño events of 1983 actually caused the La Leche River to change its course to be within seventeen feet of that pyramid ."

"51.txt","In September 1995, the Italian Carabinieri, in conjunction with Swiss police, raided Italian antiquities dealer Giacomo Medici’s storerooms in Geneva Freeport. The raids on Medici’s storerooms were part of a wide-ranging investigation into the antiquities trade out of Italy, and more raids followed in 2001 on US dealer Robert Hecht’s apartment in Paris and in 2002 and 2005 on Italian dealer Gianfranco Becchina’s premises in Basel. The accumulating evidence implicated Marion True, the then Curator of Antiquities at the J. Paul Getty Museum, and she was interviewed in 2001 by the Italian prosecutors. More evidence regarding the Getty’s involvement with the Italian antiquities trade came to light in Los Angeles, where the journalists Jason Felch and Ralph Frammolino obtained more than 1,000 pages of internal Getty documents (which the Getty maintains were stolen). These documents showed that as early as 1985 the Getty had been aware that it had been acquiring material from dubious sources in Italy and Greece, but had continued to do so regardless. In November 2005, Marion True was charged in an Italian court with conspiring to receive stolen art. The evidence collected during the course of the Italian investigation also caused several US art museums to return material to Italy. Foremost among them was the Getty. The Getty had already returned objects to Italy in 1996, 1999 and 2005. In January 2006, talks commenced between the Getty and Italian officials about further repatriations While Italy was keen to secure the return of fifty-two objects, the Getty was hoping to keep the number down to twenty-one. However, in June 2006, the Los Angeles Times revealed that an internal Getty review conducted in 2005 had reported that 350 of the museum’s antiquities had been acquired from dealers suspected or convicted of dealing in looted artefacts . An agreement was reached in June 2006 , establishing grounds for a return of objects and future cultural collaborations, but it collapsed soon after . In October 2006, an offer by the Getty to return twenty-six objects and to share ownership of the Cult Statue of a Goddess was turned down by Italy . This prompted the Getty to announce unilaterally in November 2006 that it intended to return twenty-five of the objects claimed by Italy, together with an additional one that the Getty’s own research had shown to be suspect—26 in total .Sticking points for the Getty were Italian claims made on the Statue of a Victorious Youth , and the Cult Statue of a Goddess, both of which the museum was refusing to return . Italian officials rejected the offer, threatening the Getty with a future policy of non-cooperation unless their full claim was met . Finally, in August 2007, an agreement was reached whereby the Getty would return forty objects to Italy, including the Cult Statue of a Goddess, and would retain possession of the Statue of a Victorious Youth pending the outcome of ongoing legal proceedings in Italy. The agreement also provided for future collaborations between the Getty and cultural institutions in Italy . The objects returned were: Five first-century BC Roman fresco fragments . .

Dating from about 400–300 BC, the head had been purchased in 1985 from Maurice Tempelsman for $530,000 USD. Tempelsman had in turn bought the head from British dealer Robin Symes . Research at the Getty established that the head had been looted from the Morgantina sanctuary of Demeter and Persephone in the 1970s."
"53.txt","Jiri Frel was curator of antiquities at the , and was associated with several irregularities regarding museum acquisitions. Frel arrived in the United States in 1969 from Czechoslovakia, where for the previous twenty years he had been professor of classics at Charles University in Prague. After brief stints at Princeton University’s Institute for Advanced Studies and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, he was appointed by the Getty Museum in 1973 as its first Curator of Antiquities . His work in assembling a collection of antiquities for the Getty was associated with suspicions of malpractice, and in 1984 he was placed on paid leave . He subsequently resigned in 1986 . Central to Frel’s strategy for building up the Getty’s collection was a scheme he devised that exploited US federal law on tax relief for charitable donations. He entered into an agreement with antiquities dealer Bruce McNall, who was partner with Robert Hecht at Summa Antiquities, whereby McNall would locate individuals willing to donate antiquities to the Getty in exchange for a tax deduction, and arranged through Summa to supply them with the necessary material. Frel would provide an appraised value for the donation that would be far in excess of the price paid to Summa . McNall received 10 percent commission on the price paid to Summa by the donor . The scheme’s trial run was with movie producer and coin collector Sy Weintraub, who received a tax deduction of $1.65 million USD in the first year, and $1.2 million in the second year for a pair of fourth-century BC fresco fragments he had bought from Summa for $75,000 and donated to the Getty at an appraised value of $2.5 million . Word of these profits spread, and McNall was subsequently able to attract other Hollywood celebrities and tycoons to join the scheme . As time went on, McNall’s partner Hecht would ship material directly to the Getty, where it could remain on loan until such time as McNall could arrange a donor . Frel would also supply inflated appraisals for pieces bought at public auction—for example a Roman head bought for $900 was valued at $45,000, and two sarcophagus fragments bought together for $4,000 were valued at $40,000 . Frel initially obtained appraisals from New York antiquities dealer Jerome Eisenberg , but after acquiring a stock of Eisenberg’s letter-headed notepaper, began to prepare them himself, instructing his secretary to forge Eisenberg’s signature . Between 1973 and 1985, Frel attracted 6,453 objects from dozens of donors, valued at just over $14 million . By way of comparison, Thomas Hoving estimated that during his ten-year term as director, the Metropolitan Museum’s twenty-two departments had between them received only $6 million worth of donated artefacts . Frel also used his donation scheme to fool the Getty’s trustees. He would gain their approval for a price to be paid for an acquisition in excess of what he had agreed with the vendor, and use the difference to buy more material from the dealer concerned. This material could also be fed into the museum through the donation scheme . It has been claimed that Frel’s schemes were intended to establish the Getty as a major scholarly museum, and thathis object in acquiring the donations was to establish a ‘research collection’ that would never have been approved by the trustees, who were interested only in high-priced display objects. Although he seems not to have benefited personally from the donations, he did receive payments from antiquities dealers as commission for helping to arrange sales to collectors or to the Getty . In 1983, several Getty donors were interviewed by the Internal Revenue Service, and the Getty launched an internal probe into Frel’s activities. He was placed on paid leave in 1984, whereupon he departed for Europe. He stayed in Paris for a few months, and then at the Castelvetrano home of Italian antiquities dealer Gianfranco Becchina, before settling in an apartment in Rome. He resigned from the Getty in 1986, and it was subsequently revealed that he had been responsible for the acquisition of several high-profile and expensive, possible fakes, including a fragment of a supposedly sixth-century BC marble funerary relief, a marble head said to be by the fourth-century BC Greek sculptor Scopas, and the Getty Kouros . Frel died in 2006 . Thomas Hoving later discovered that not all of the ‘donors’ had been aware of their donations made in their names, and that, presumably in consequence, tax deductions had not been claimed on all donations. He surmised that the donation scheme might actually have been part of a larger plan concocted by Frel and Gianfranco Becchina to launder or render invisible to Swiss tax authorities the large profits Becchina had made selling the Getty what are now alleged to be fake artifacts (Hoving 2009"
"54.txt","In 2001 a rich tomb was systematically looted at the Iranian site of Jiroft. Artefacts from this looting were trafficked out of Iran and several individuals involved were sentenced to death. In around 2001, a tomb, rich in decorated artefacts, was discovered at Jiroft, in Iran’s southern province of Kerman . There is some debate as to the exact date of discovery , with Lawler and Covington both suggesting that discovery was in 2000 rather than 2001, but it that organised and systematic looting by local residents broke out soon after in the surrounding area, with some reports that individual families were allocated specific ‘plots’ to dig . In 2002, Iran’s Islamic Police moved in to stop the illicit digging . However, by then it was estimated by some that up to 100,000 objects may have been removed, although it is not certain exactly how many were actually lost . The types of artefacts typically associated with Jiroft include portable objects made of chlorite, a soapstone-like mineral occurring in a range of colours , and to a lesser extent other materials such as ‘bronze, copper, terracotta and even lapis lazuli’ . The artwork on the artefacts include ‘a bewildering variety of plants, buildings, and half-animal, half-human figures including strange scorpion men and kneeling women between horned animals’ . While some artefacts attributed to Jiroft were later seized in other parts of Iran, such as Yazd , many more were likely illegally exported, including to the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom . Iran moved to call for repatriation of artefacts believed to have originated in the Jiroft area, and among other actions circulated “four comprehensive books on Jiroft artefacts for major European museums and urged their directors to send back all similar artefacts to Iran” . In addition, Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence worked alongside Interpol to try to recover artefacts attributed to Jiroft from suspected smugglers . In 2003, 80 Jiroft artefacts were found to be on sale in London for £600,000 , and similarly in 2002 vases believed to be from the plundered area were on sale in Drouot in Paris, allegedly consigned for sale by several Paris-based dealers . An object discovered on sale at Sotheby’s auction house in London (vendor a French institute) was repatriated after legal proceedings involving the Iranian Cultural Heritage and Tourism Organisation . In 2005, following a successful repatriation claim to the UK government by the Iranian government, a ceremony was held at the National Museum in Tehran, to mark the return of 118 Jiroft artefacts from London . Signifying the gravity with which the Iranian authorities are taking the looting at Jiroft, two men convicted of trafficking antiquities were sentenced to death in 2004 ; the first time the death sentence has been used in Iran for antiquities trafficking . There has been ongoing debate as to the historical and archaeological significance of the culture discovered at Jiroft, with some suggesting that the material culture could represent a civilisation at least as important as ancient Mesopotamia . However, Muscarella has pointed out that, because of the clandestine nature of the removal of the majority of the artefacts associated with Jiroft, including the possibility of a considerable proportion of fakes, any archaeological assertions stemming from the research of any of the looted (or faked) artefacts is problematic. However, some authorised archaeological excavations have also taken place in the region . The Iranian Cultural Heritage News Agency (CHN) reported in 2005 that looting had finally ended in Jiroft after three years – fuelled for so long by the relative poverty of local residents who were tempted by the promise of financial return from digging up the artefacts . In December 2007, following an appeal to an earlier court case, the Iranian government secured the right of ownership for eight artefacts believed to have been excavated illegally from the Jiroft region, which had been on sale at a Mayfair gallery in London ."
"55.txt","The Bourne Collection is a collection of Pre-Conquest metal objects, some of which were purchased in the United States in 1987 and were later identified as being from the site of Sipán, Peru. For several years the New Mexico History Museum at the Palace of the Governors in Santa Fe ‘courted’ local collector John Bourne with the hope that he would donate his collection of Pre-Conquest metal objects to the museum. In 1995 Bourne donated a gold monkey head bead from Peru and a Panamanian gold pectoral to the museum. Bourne then loaned the museum several objects, including two gold Moche ear spools and a gold Moche rattle, which went on display in 1996 . In 1997 Bourne pledged to donate his entire collection to the museum, a gift valued at about 2 million USD . FBI Investigation Following a visit to the museum in 1998, Peruvian archaeologist Walter Alva speculated that the monkey bead came from the famously looted Moche site of Sipán in Peru’s Lambayeque Valley. He contacted the FBI who sent Special Agents Bob Wittman and Brian Midkiff to meet with then director of the museum Thomas E Chávez on 29 September 1998 . Chávez told the agents that Bourne had implied, although not directly said, that he had inherited the donated pieces from his father who imported them into the US long before specific import restrictions were put in place. Chávez said that the museum would be happy to cooperate with the return of the object if it could be proved to have been looted. The agents then met with John Bourne who told them that the pieces had not come from his father, rather that they were purchased in 1987 from a dealer named Ben Johnson who had died in 1990 . Benjamin Bishop Johnson was a former art historian and conservator who entered the art dealership business in 1979 due to severe medical issues . According to the testimony of Michael Kelly, a man involved in an antiquities smuggling ring, in 1987 Johnson purchased a shipment of material from Sipán only six months after the site was looted. The objects had been routed through the UK by David Swetnam with the aid of Kelly who was to assert a false provenance for the pieces . Bourne told the FBI agents that he paid Johnson in cash for the items in question and did not ask for a receipt . The monkey head bead, along with the two ear spools and the gold rattle also from the Bourne collection, were impounded by the FBI at Peru’s request under the US National Stolen Property Act . Bourne claimed that the pieces came from the looted archaeological site of La Mina, a claim that would exempt the pieces from the 1990 US emergency import restrictions placed on antiquities from Sipán. Archaeologists such as Walter Alva determined that the objects had been recently looted and came either from La Mina or Sipán, but could not conclusively determine exactly which of these two related Moche sites they came from . This determination did not satisfy Chávez, who maintained that there was still no conclusive proof that the Bourne Collection objects had been looted. According to Alva ‘what that museum did was launder stolen property’; according to Chávez ‘Alva wanted to do a reverse looting…I am not going to let that happen without some proof’ . In 2000 the ’s office decided not to prosecute, both because Bourne stated he purchased the artefacts in the US in 1987 (before import restrictions were established for Peruvian artefacts) and because the pieces could not be definitively assigned to Sipán. The objects were returned to the museum and museum officials vowed to research the provenance of all the objects . Return of the Monkey Head Bead to Peru In May 2008 the museum formally closed its exhibit ‘Art of Ancient America’, which was composed of pieces from the Bourne Collection, and announced that they would not be seeking the donation of the collection. Francis Levine, who became the director of the museum after Chávez retired in 2004, stated that in the long run the museum wished to focus on the history of New Mexico and that the Bourne Collection did not fit with this vision . All of the objects loaned by Bourne were returned, but the museum kept the objects that had already been formally donated, including the monkey head bead. At the time Bourne expressed interest in creating his own museum . In 2007, Spain returned a similar monkey head bead to Peru . This return renewed interest in the New Mexico case and in May 2011, the Peruvian government again sought the return of the monkey head bead. An investigation led the US Attorney’s office in the District of Delaware to declare that the bead came from Sipán . In response to these findings, the New Mexico History Museum board of regents voted in October 2011 to return the bead to Peru. Karen Durkovitch, president of the boar, stated that they ‘gave the matter our serious consideration and came to the conclusion that it’s appropriate to work collaboratively with the Peruvian government’ . On 8 December, 2011, a ceremony was held at the Peruvian Embassy in Washington ‘Art of Ancient America’ exhibit in Santa Fe . Levine said ‘we’ve seen that many cultures want certain things back because their emotional tie is so strong to the materials and to the legends and the stories and the history. It’s truly their cultural patrimony’ . ‘A reputation for integrity, cultural sensitivity and cooperation are critical to us and foremost in our considerations regarding this request’ . Levine also acknowledged the museum’s interest in reuniting the monkey head bead with the one returned by Spain in 2007. When asked to comment on the return of the monkey head bead, Bourne said that he was pleased with the repatriation: ‘I support the process of due diligence that has led to it returning to Peru’ (Bourne quoted in . Bourne defended his decision to donate the bead to the museum: ‘It was nice to have it here. A lot of people couldn’t afford to go to Peru or even to New York to see these kinds of things. A lot of people here saw the monkey head’ . When interviewed, he declined to comment on how the piece entered the United States . Donation of the Collection to the Walters Art Museum In 2009, seventy pieces from the Bourne Collection were donated to the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore with 230 more pieces promised by the collector. Bourne also bequeathed 4 million USD from his estate to the Walters to endow a centre for the study of the art of the ancient Americas . This donation included the ear spools (also known as earflares) and the ornament that were subject to the original FBI seizure. They are listed on the Walters website as being from the ‘North Coast, Peru’ and their provenance is listed as ‘John G. Bourne, 1980s, by purchase’ (presumably meaning purchased by Bourne; Accession number TL.2009.20.65 and TL.2009.20.71; (The Walters Art Museum)). Further contextual information is not provided."
"56.txt","The Kumluca Silver is a collection of more than forty sixth-century AD Byzantine silver artefacts, thought to have been found close to the small town of Kumluca in southern Turkey, and bought by Dumbarton Oaks in 1963. In 1963, Dumbarton Oaks, in Washington, DC, acquired a collection of sixth-century AD Byzantine liturgical silverware – more than forty objects altogether comprising dishes, crosses, candlesticks and other items. The Dumbarton director John Thacher had viewed the silver in Switzerland, where it was in the possession of Turkish antiquities dealer George Zacos, before it was purchased by Mrs Robert Woods Bliss for $1 million and donated to the museum . It is believed that the silver had been found buried in a mound known as Büyük Asar at the small town of Kumluca (ancient Corydalla), about twenty miles from Antalya, Turkey. Unbeknownst to Thacher, however, the material on offer was only part of a larger trove, and the remainder had been acquired by the Antalya Museum and dispatched to Istanbul for study by Nizeh Firath of the Istanbul Archaeological Museum. Firath understood that the material he was studying was incomplete and said so at a 1964 meeting in Athens while he was presenting a paper on his research. Dumbarton Oaks subsequently displayed its newly acquired silver as part of the ‘Sion Treasure’ , noting that while a significant part of this treasure was in its possession, another part was in the Antalya Museum. Altogether, the find is thought to comprise more than fifty pieces, including two artefacts in undisclosed private collections . Most of the material is thought to derive from a single church. The treasure was named from a niello inscription on an oblong polycandelon (multiple-lamp holder) mentioning ‘Holy Sion,’ possibly the church or the monastery for which the objects were made . The monastery of Holy Sion was sixty miles from present-day Kumluca, and there may have also been a church of Holy Sion in or near Kumluca . Because of the clandestine nature of the treasure’s recovery, the date of, and reasons for its burial are not known. Close analysis of the assemblage has also suggested that some pieces might be missing, though whether they were abstracted before deposition or after recovery remains an open question . It was rumoured during the 1960s that additional pieces from Kumluca, including a baptismal font, were circulating on the antiquities market in Europe, though this has never been confirmed . Zacos had acquired the silver in Kumluca in 1962, but left Turkey in 1963 to avoid official investigation . In 1970, the then Turkish Minister of Education Orhan Orguz revealed that a letter written to Dumbarton Oaks from the Turkish government asking for the return of the silver had been ignored . Negotiations subsequently opened in the 1980s, but were inconclusive . In March 2012, Turkey requested the return of dozens of artefacts from several US museums, including the Kumluca Silver from Dumbarton Oaks . Dumbarton Oaks replied with a press statement asserting their proper title to the material ."
"57.txt","A classic Maya stela, cut into pieces for transport, which ended up in the collection of Sweden’s National Museum. It was returned to Guatemala in , Guatemala. Occupation was brief at La Amelia: the site dates entirely to the Late Classic period and it was the first polity in the region to be abandoned around 830AD during the Classic Maya collapse. The site may have originally been called B’ahlam, or ‘Jaguar’, based on inscriptions found at the larger site of Dos Pilas . In 1937 a team from the Carnegie Institution headed by Ledyard Smith, , and Edwin M. Shook excavated at La Amelia . Among the monuments they recorded was Stela 1 which was published in Sylvanus G. Moreley’s Inscriptions of Peten . The stela depicts one of the last lords of Amelia, Lachan K’awill Ajaw B’ot, who was born on 25 June 760 AD and enthroned on 1 May 802 AD, as a ballplayer standing upon a jaguar (Escobedo ). Stela 1 was looted from La Amelia in 1965 . Although the stela was found broken into two sections in 1937 (a diagonal break at the figure’s shins), the looters professionally cut the piece under the figure’s feet. This allowed them to transport the much smaller lower register, which depicts a jaguar. The upper pieces of the stela were left behind . Sometime in the late 1960s, Shook revisited the site and found the lower portion of the stela to be missing .[1] Shook then had the remaining portions of the stela transported to the town of Sayaxché and later to Guatemala’s Instituto de Antropología e Historia for safe keeping . According to a press release from the Instituto de Antropología e Historia , after it was looted, the lower portion of the stela was smuggled to New York City where it was displayed in the gallery of the late Everett Rassiga. Rassiga was a dealer of Latin American antiquities who was associated with the transport of the Placeres Temple Facade and some Las Bocas-style figurines. The fragment was reportedly in Rassiga’s possession in 1969 when it was included among a list of looted Maya sculptures in Clemency Coggins’ seminal paper on illicit Pre-Columbian antiquities . Coggins reported that at some point the bottom portion was lent to an exhibition in Paris where it was temporarily reunited with its upper portion . Archaeologist Merle Greene Robertson records that Rassiga did not suspect the fragment was stolen and offered it back to Guatemala if the country would reimburse him the $5,000 he paid for it; Guatemala refused . Sometime in the late 1960s or early 1970s the fragment was purchased by Ernest Ericson, a Swedish national involved in shipping, who later brought it to Sweden. After Ericson’s death, the stela fragment became the property of the Ericson Foundation which then donated it to the Swedish National Museum in Stockholm . In 1984, archaeologist Ian Graham identified the fragment as having come from La Amelia . In 1991 the fragment was transferred from the National Museum to the Folkens Museum Etnografiska (People’s Museum of Ethnography) in Stockholm. In March 1994 archaeologist Karl-Herbert Mayer contacted the Folkens Museum Etnografiska, informing them that the stela had been looted, and inquiring about any plans for return. The museum immediately agreed to return the fragment and on 17 April 1994 the stela’s pieces were reunited in Guatemala. This return was hailed by Guatemala as a perfect example of voluntary cooperation in the preservation of Maya cultural patrimony and the return of looted material . Stela 1 is not the only monument known to have been stolen from La Amelia. Over 90 percent of the site has been looted . In 1937 Shook and his team recorded six hieroglyphic blocks that once formed a monolithic stairway . None of the original staircase blocks were at La Amelia by 1997 and they have all presumably been looted ."
"58.txt","A Moche funerary site in Northern Peru that was looted for spectacular gold objects during the same looting wave that hit following the discovery of the famous lord of Sipán tomb. The site of La Mina, also known as Huaca de la Mina or Cerro de la Mina, is located in the Jequetepeque Valley of Peru’s north coast, about five kilometres from the sea. It is named after an abandoned gold mine which is known to have been used in the Inka period and perhaps before. It is one of the few sites in which the early Moche period has been excavated by archaeologists. In mid-1988, objects from a rich Moche tomb began to appear on the art market. They were similar in style to the famous (and recently looted) objects from Sipán, but were different enough iconographically that experts doubted that they came from the same site. Rumours abounded that the pieces came from a site somewhere in the Jequetepeque Valley . Archaeologist Christopher Donnan and colleagues spent nearly a month searching for the site, both on the ground and via aerial photography, without locating it . On 11 May 1989, archaeologist Walter Alva was contacted by an unnamed antiquities collector based in Trujillo . The collector told Alva that the fine objects on the market were from La Mina which, like Sipán, was not originally thought to have been used by the Moche. An unemployed farmer and known looter had located Moche material while digging at the site. The looter followed a tunnel that had been carved into the natural hillside and stumbled on a spectacularly rich Moche tomb . The looter told no one of his find, ‘withdrawing’ gold objects from the tomb whenever he needed the money. Because of the high quality of the objects and the time that elapsed between objects appearing for sale, the collector initially suspected that the objects were fakes manufactured by local dealers. However, upon discovering the identity of the original looter and questioning him, the collector was able to tie the pieces to La Mina. The collector feared that word had spread about the discovery, and that the La Mina tomb would be destroyed by swarms of looters before archaeologists could study it. He hoped for Alva, famous for his Sipán intervention, to protect the site . Upon reaching La Mina, Alva encountered several looters in the process of digging . By then the tomb, which was painted with murals of snakes and stingrays, had been completely emptied. A rescue excavation was launched. According to Kirkpatrick , the art market’s reception of the looted La Mina material was ’lukewarm’, at least compared to the response to comparable objects from Sipán. Although the quality of the La Mina material was spectacular, Kirkpatrick speculated that the poor publicity associated with Sipán had spoiled the market for new Moche material. Nevertheless, as later returns would attest, much looted La Mina material was illegally exported from Perú. The coincidental connection of the looting of La Mina to the looting of Sipán became a factor in investigations into the John Bourne Collection. For years, Bourne maintained that certain Moche gold objects in his collection came from La Mina, not Sipán . If true, these claims would have tied Bourne’s collection to the looting of La Mina, which is known to have occurred in 1988. The suggestion that objects in the Bourne Collection came from La Mina had the effect of exempting them from scrutiny where they were imported after the 1990 US emergency import restrictions on Sipán objects and before the 1997 US-Perú antiquities bilateral agreement[1]. That said, in 2011 a gold monkey head bead, formerly in the John Bourne Collection, was returned to Perú with the understanding that it came from Sipán and not La Mina. Perhaps the most famous object from La Mina is a large golden headdress of a tentacled zoomorphic sea god. The headdress was most likely removed from La Mina during the initial 1988 looting of the site . It was allegedly purchased, along with other La Mina items, by the collector Raul Apesteguía, who sold it on to Costa Rican dealer/collector Leonardo Patterson . Apesteguía was brutally murdered in his home on 26 January 1996: he was beaten to death and six boxes of pre-Conquest gold and ceramics were taken from his collection . The police determined that he died at the hands of an antiquities trafficking mob with whom he was associated. An August 1996 raid at Lima’s international airport produced three objects taken during the Apesteguía murder, along with 445 other artefacts which were in the process of being shipped to French dealer Yves de Parceval . The sea god headdress, along with other Peruvian objects linked to Apesteguía, appeared in a 1997 catalogue[2] that accompanied an exhibition of Patterson’s collection at the Museo do Pobo Galego in Santiago de Compostela, Spain . By 2006 the piece was in Belgium and on the market, fromwhere it was trafficked into the UK. It was recovered by London’s Metropolitan Police and returned to Perú in August 2006 . According to the Guardian newspaper, ‘a London solicitor’s firm had facilitated the return on behalf of their client after an intelligence-led investigation’ . Reportedly, the piece was offered to an undercover agent who agreed to pay an unnamed collector £1 million for the object if the exchange was made in London . Several reports state that a key player in this sting was the Dutch art dealer Michel van Rijn and, in turn, van Rijn has stated in interviews that Leonardo Patterson was the collector who was the target of the sting . Based on the contents of the 1997 catalogue and at the urging of Walter Alva, a Peruvian court issued an arrest warrant for Patterson in 2004 . As a result of that investigation, in 2008, the government of Spain officially returned 45 Peruvian cultural objects that had been seized in the 2007 raid of a warehouse owned by Patterson . Twelve of these pieces are thought to have come from Sipán but many of the others, including gold masks, jewellery, and ceramics are thought to have come from La Mina . Patterson claimed that all the objects were on loan from German millionaire Anton Roeckl . On 5 August 2009, (ICE) seized two ceramic artefacts on a Swiss Air flight from Zurich to JFK International Airport in New York. The objects appeared to be from La Mina or the nearby Moche site of Dos Cabezas, and were in the posession of Roeckl . The ICE determined that the invoices Roeckl held were misleading insofar as they indicated that the objects had been purchased in Germany in the 1960s. The pieces were returned to Perú as part of a settlement with Roeckl ."
"59.txt","Remote Peruvian funerary site where numerous mummies were mutilated by incidental looters looking for sellable metal objects. The Laguna de los Cóndores, also known as the Laguna de las Momias, is a lagoon located in the department of Amazonas in northern Peru; a day’s hike from the village of Leymebamba. The cliffs surrounding the lagoon were used as a necropolis by the Chachapoya, a culture that lived in cordillera (mountains) between the Marañón and Huallaga rivers in the high Andean cloud forest . The Chachapoya may have been less an organized socio-political unit and more a regional identity that was called ‘Chachapoya’ by the Inka for administrative convenience . The region was conquered by Tupac Inca Yupanqui around 1470 AD and under the Inka, the Chachapoya were subject to forced resettlement (von Hagen ). What some have termed the ‘Classic’ Chachapoya civilization lasted from around 800 AD until the period between the Inka Conquest and the Spanish Conquest (von Hagan ). This period is characterised by tombs of the sort seen at Laguna de los Cóndores. Chullpas at Laguna de los Condores with view of lagoon, Photo by Daniel Fernandez-Davila The tombs at Laguna de los Cóndores are located on a cliff 100 metres above the Lagoon. There are six intact chullpas[1], above-ground stone structures meant for housing the dead, and the remains of a seventh are visible (von Hagen ). The chullpas are set in rows and are decorated: four of them are painted in white, red, and yellow pigment and two display zigzag friezes (von Hagen ). The ledges are dry, which has aided in the preservation of both bodies and organic grave goods. Finds at Laguna de los Cóndores suggest that the chullpas date to the period of Inka control over the Chachapoya-Inka . It appears as if two of the chullpas at the site were hastily constructed by the incoming Inka to house Chachapoya mummies relocated from the other chullpas. These other chullpas were then reused by the Inka and their local administrators (von Hagen ). Preserved feather headdress from Laguna de los Condores. Photo from the Museo Leymebamba website. In 1996, men working for a Leymebamba-based cattle rancher named Julio Ullilén discovered the tombs at Laguna de los Cóndores . Upon finding the chullpas to be filled with mummies, the men proceeded to hack at the well-preserved, textile-covered bodies with machetes in an effort to find sellable metal artefacts . A fight over the spoils of the looting eventually led to the intervention of the local police and most of the looters were arrested . At this point Ullilén had taken many of the artefacts stolen by the looters, but the police eventually confiscated these items . Ullilén is now the manager of a hostel in Leymebamba that offers tours of the archaeological site (see ). Chullpas at Laguna de los Condores with mummy bundle, Photo by Daniel Fernandez-Davila In April 1997, archaeologist Peter Lerche visited the site as an official representative of Peru’s National Institute of Culture to conduct a preliminary survey of the damage. He estimated that there were 60 to 70 mummy bundles and hundreds of associated artefacts, including several khipus[2], scattered on the cliff ledge . Later salvage archaeology at the site revealed that the publicity surrounding the looting incident was having a negative effect on the already-damaged necropolis. Adventure tourists were moving mummies around, posing them for photos, and casually stealing artefacts as souvenirs . The movement of the mummies by tourists and looters had exposed several bodies to the rain, and archaeologists, in consultation with local and national authorities, decided that the bodies could not remain at the site . Thus 219 mummies and over 2,400 artefacts were transported for ten hours along a horse trail to Leymebamba where they were conserved . They are now housed at the Museo Leymebamba."

"60.txt","A popular style of Olmec figurine said to be from the Mexican site of Las Bocas that was defined entirely by looted material that appeared on the art market. The archaeological site of Las Bocas is located 7 km east of the town of Izúcar de Matamoros near the village of San José Las Bocas in the Mexican state of Puebla. The site is associated with the Olmec culture, a Formative/Preclassic period civilization which dominated the region from approximately 1500 to 400 BC. In the 1960s, Las Bocas became famous for a particular style of Olmec figurine. Called ‘Las Bocas style’ after the site, this style was largely defined by the art market in response to a number of unprovenienced antiquities that were being sold by intermediaries in Mexico City. The compromised nature of the site of Las Bocas and the lack of archaeological excavation in the area mean that ceramic objects on the art market ‘represented the sole information used to evaluate the Olmec dilemma in southern Puebla’ . It is considered highly unlikely that all of the unprovenienced Las Bocas-style artefacts that have been bought and sold actually came from Las Bocas as will be detailed below. In a situation much like that of the contemporaneous Mexican site of Xochipala, the combination of a systematically looted site and an artefact class defined by an unprovenienced artistic style has produced a significant amount of confusion in the understanding of the Olmec generally and of the people of Las Bocas specifically. Las Bocas Figurines The quintessential Las Bocas-style figurine is the so-called ‘baby-face’ figure, epitomized by an unprovenienced figurine now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art . The piece and those like it are constructed out of white clay (or are white slipped), are hollow, and depict seated pudgy infants, some with adult traits . The Las Bocas-style ‘baby-face’ figurine in the Metropolitan has ‘the typical trough-shaped eyes, downturned mouth, and fleshy cheeks’ which characterize the ‘baby-face’ type . It came to the museum from the collection of Nelson Rockefeller by way of the Museum of Primitive Art. Rockefeller is listed as purchasing the piece from antiquities dealer Everett Rassiga in 1965 (Metropolitan Museum of Art ). According to an article published by archaeologist David Friedel, which was based on first-hand accounts from the looters involved (personal communication), Rassiga was alleged to have been involved later in the attempted sale of a large looted Maya temple façade from the site of Placeres in Mexico . Las Bocas Style: Popularity and Consequence Although the moniker ‘Las Bocas’ had already been applied to a particular style of Olmec figurines, it wasn’t until the publication of the book The Jaguar Children by archaeologist Michael Coe in 1965 that the Las Bocas style received international attention and acclaim . In The Jaguar Children, Coe refers to Las Bocas as being a cemetery. However several seasons of excavations conducted by Mexican archaeologist María de la Cruz Paillés Hernándezes turned up only one grave and no clear evidence of a necropolis . Paillés Hernándezes states that only an as-yet-to-be-identified cemetery could account for the sheer number of so-called Las Bocas figurines in private collections and in foreign museums, but that the ‘cemetery’ is a ‘non-existent type of archaeological site in Mesoamerica’ . She believes it is much more likely that ‘the high prices that pieces attributed to Las Bocas reach in the illegal market of archaeological objects may entice those who auction and sell pieces to “label” them as originating from this site’ . The use of ‘Las Bocas’ as a label of quality (and popularity) rather than an indication of archaeological find-spot is mentioned in much of the recent archaeological literature on the subject of Olmec iconography. For example Blomster notes that by the mid 1960s, ‘Las Bocas had already gained a reputation for yielding objects of the finest caliber’, and that ‘because of the reputation of the site, the most aesthetically pleasing hollow babies that appear in museum collections invariably are labeled Las Bocas’. He recounts that early collectors of this style of figurine purchased the pieces primarily in Mexico City from intermediaries and that the Las Bocas-style artefacts ‘do not show attributes suggestive of a single manufacturing locus’ . It is unclear exactly how and why the site of Las Bocas became associated with these figurines. Archaeology at Las Bocas In 1967 Román Piña Chan from Mexico’s National Museum of Anthropology excavated four test units at the site of Caballo Pintado which is now considered to be the main settlement of the Las Bocas site . Archaeologists did not inspect the site again until 1995 and then from 1997 to 2000 when a team led by Paillés Hernández excavated at what is now termed Las Bocas-Caballo Pintado . Paillés Hernández chose Las Bocas for archaeological study precisely because it has been so heavily looted. In response to critics who felt that it was ‘too late’ to glean archaeological information from Las Bocas due to intensive looting, Paillés Hernández has stated that those very circumstances ‘urge us, from the scientific and ethical perspective, and in our role of professional archaeologists, to carry out extensive explorations at Las Bocas-Caballo Pintado, aimed at recovering every possible bit of information…’ . In 2002 several of the local workers associated with Paillés Hernández’s archaeological project gave some informal statements about the looting of the site in the 1960s. Noting that many of the small looters holes were narrow but deep, some of the workers stated that when they were boys in the 1960s they would observe the illegal excavations. They said that as opposed to the larger looters pits that were run by males, female looters were placed in charge of these ‘small excavations’ at Las Bocas . Conducting archaeological work has been difficult and even dangerous in the region. Paillés Hernández recounts that in 2000, kidnapping perpetrated by criminal gangs were a constant part of life in the area. During their excavations at Las Bocas-Caballo Pintado that year, several inhabitants of the municipality were kidnapped and near the end of excavations ‘helicopters from the state of Puebla’s Attorney General’s office would fly over [their] excavations… in an attempt to spot the criminals who customarily hid in the many caves from the nearby hills…’ . During excavation in 1998 Paillés Hernández found the fragmentary and charred leg of a hollow ‘baby-face’ figurine, however most of the figurine pieces recovered through excavation were rendered in solid clay . The hollow leg is too fragmentary to classify properly and may not actually be from a ‘Las Bocas-style’ figurine . To date there is no archaeological evidence that links the site of Las Bocas to the corpus of Las Bocas-style figurines in international collections."
"61.txt","Well-known Olmec greenstone statue stolen from a Mexican museum and abandoned in a Texas hotel room after traffickers were unable to sell it. Discovery On 16 July 1965, Severiano and Rosa Manuel Pascual, two children from the village of Las Limas in the Mexican state of Veracruz, were looking for a rock to break open fruit . Digging around what they thought to be a normal stone, the children uncovered the face of the Olmec statue which would come to be known as Las Limas Monument 1 or el Señor de Las Limas . These very young children alerted the rest of their village as they initially thought they had discovered a dead person . The statue was brought to the Pascual home and was used as an altar under the belief that it represented an apparition of the Virgin . Archaeologist Alfonso Medellín Zenil eventually moved the sculpture to the Museum of Anthropology at Xalapa . He and his colleagues interviewed the children who described their find in detail and brought the archaeologists to the discovery spot. Archaeological excavations carried out on and near the find-site of the statue produced no notable archaeological remains . The Statue Las Limas Monument 1 is about 55 cm tall and weighs about 60 kg making it the largest known Olmec greenstone sculpture . It was probably carved during the Mesoamerican Middle Formative Period . The piece depicts a poorly-understood, controversial, and fascinating scene from Olmec mythology. A male youth, seated cross-legged, holds in his outstretched arms a limp and inert “were-jaguar” baby (a humanoid baby with feline facial qualities) as if offering it to something or someone . Some interpret this scene, which is portrayed on other Olmec monuments, to be evidence of child sacrifice, however details of Olmec religious beliefs and practices are limited. Of great importance are four incised depictions of deities on the youth’s knees and shoulders. These deities are repeated on other Olmec monuments and sculptures and their presence in the iconography of this important scene is interpreted as an indication of their prominence. Theft and Return On 12 October 1972 , Las Limas Monument 1 was stolen from the museum at Xalapa and smuggled into the United States for sale on the market . However, because this monument was well known and clearly stolen from a state museum, it proved difficult to sell. When a buyer backed out of the sale, the traffickers abandoned the statue in a motel room in San Antonio, Texas, where the police recovered it. The local sheriff contacted Mexican authorities and it was then returned to the museum at Xalapa . Meyer notes that despite the importance of this sculpture, its theft and eventual recovery in the US was not reported in the English-language press."
"62.txt","A Moche or Vicús cultural site that was heavily looted in the 1960s and 1970s for metal objects, many of which are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The site of Loma Negra is located in Peru‘s upper Piura Valley, 2.5 km east of kilometer 972 North on the Pan American highway. In 1969 looters located the cemetery at Loma Negra . Hundreds of Moche or Vicús metal artefacts were looted from an undetermined number of deep shaft tombs . The cultural attribution of these objects is controversial to some degree. They have been attributed to the Vicús Culture, the Moche Culture, or some sort of combination of the two. Due to the looted nature of the corpus, little can be determined about Moche/Vicús interaction in the Loma Negra region. The objects from Loma Negra that have appeared on the art market are primarily made of sheet metal. The seeming lack of ceramic objects from Loma Negra coupled with the lack of archaeological context for the looted objects have made it particularly difficult to fit Loma Negra into the greater Moche sequence developed from archaeological excavations . The looting incidents and subsequent archaeological investigations at the Moche sites of Sipán and La Mina have shed some light on the Loma Negra corpus. By drawing parallels between those sites, it is now generally believed that the metal objects from Loma Negra represent the grave goods of an unknown number of elite Moche/Vicús individuals. A significant number of objects from Loma Negra entered into the collection of the Museum of Primitive Art, New York in the 1970s via loans from and bequests of Nelson and Michael Rockefeller. In an effort to better understand this collection, Anne-Louise Schaffer began a project to catalogue Loma Negra objects under the supervision of the museum’s curator of Precolumbian Art, Julie Jones . Schaffer recorded around 700 metal objects thought to have come from the looting of Loma Negra . The bulk of the Loma Negra material held by the Museum of Primitive Art was transferred to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1979 along with the rest of the Museum of Primitive Art collection. Indeed, between 1979 and 1987, around 400 Loma Negra objects entered the collection of the MET . According to the provenance notes on the website of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, most of the Loma Negra material they received by way of The Museum of Primitive Art was purchased from the Andre Emmerich Gallery, New York, in 1969. Other pieces are recorded as being purchased from dealers Juan Luis Pereira, Leon J. Buki (Miami, FL) or Alan C. Lapiner by Arnold L. and Jane Costello Goldberg as early as 1969 and 1970 (Metropolitan Museum of Art )."

"65.txt","In 2008, a US army helicopter pilot pled guilty to possessing and selling antiquities stolen from an Egyptian storeroom that had been excavated from the site of Ma’adi. The Egyptian Predynastic (fourth millenium BC) site of Ma’adi on the outskirts of Cairo was archaeologically excavated from the 1930s through to the 1950s, and full publication in a series of monographs is ongoing. Sometime in 2002, seventy artifacts from Ma’adi were reported stolen from a storage facility at Cairo University . Five stone and two ceramic vessels turned up for sale at Bonhams in their October 2004 London ‘Antiquities’ sale and were recognized as being from the Ma’adi theft by Egyptologist Luc Watrin, who alerted Bonhams and stopped their sale. The vessels were said to have been sold to the consignor by the grandson of one Joseph Garnish, who was said in turn to have acquired them while working in Cairo for a mining company in the 1930s. Bonhams arranged with the consignor that the pieces be returned to Egypt, and in February 2005 they were delivered to the Egyptian Embassy in London. The identity of the consignor was not revealed. Another Ma’adi piece was sold for $6,573 USD through Christie’s New York at their June 2004 ‘Antiquities’ sale. It was lot 99, ‘An Egyptian rose granite vessel’, said to have been excavated at Ma’adi and in the Garnish collection since the 1930s. The purchaser (whose name was not revealed) offered the piece on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, whereupon the Metropolitan’s staff recognized the piece as stolen, and arranged with the owner for it to be returned to Egypt. Pages from Bonhams auction catalogue By 2004, a large number of Ma’adi pots had appeared for sale on various websites. Part of the Ma’adi ceramic assemblage had been studied for publication between 1984 and 1985, at which time the pottery was still in storage at the site . Therefore, any pottery from the publication could only have moved out of Egypt illegally after 1983, the date of the Egyptian patrimony law that took archaeological heritage into State ownership. The pots offered for sale on the Internet were advertised with photographs, and sometimes an excavation number was provided, in which cases they were easy to check against the 1987 Rizkana and Seeher publication. One pot, offered for sale by Michigan-based Orpheus Art with the description ‘Predynastic opium poppy vase’ , had the excavation number 1915 and had been published in Rizkana and Seeher . Its provenance on the Orpheus website was given as ‘Johnson family collection, excavated in Egypt approx. 1932’. Thus the Garnish–Johnson pedigree was a false provenance constructed to cover the entry onto the market of material illegally exported from Egypt, and any object bearing that provenance must be viewed as suspect. All of the Ma’adi pots offered for sale on the Internet had the same Johnson provenance. By 2005 item no 90069 had been sold and the Orpheus Art website disappeared from the Internet sometime in 2006. An apparent link between the Johnson family and Joseph Garnish was provided in 2004 for a pot offered for sale on the website of the Wallis Gallery of Antiquities. The previous owner was identified as the proprietor of Washington DC-based Sands of Time Antiquities, who was said to have acquired the piece in 2003. Sometime previously, the pot was said to have been in the possession of Edward Johnson, the grandson of Joseph Garner (sic.), who supposedly acquired the piece while working on a mining project in Cairo during the 1930s. When the proprietor of the Wallis Gallery became aware of the questionable history of his piece he returned it to Sands of Time. In turn, Sands of Time started working with the Art Loss Register (ALR) to recover material stolen from Ma’adi. The ALR alerted US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). In February 2008, ICE announced the arrest of US Army helicopter pilot Edward George Johnson on charges relating to the sale of artifacts from Ma’adi. Johnson had been on active service in Cairo from February to October 2002, where he had been assigned to the US embassy. On his return to the US in January 2003 he had contacted Sue McGovern, proprietor of Sands of Time, claiming that the Ma’adi artifacts which were then in his possession had belonged to his grandfather who had acquired them in Egypt during the 1930s and 1940s. He had used his diplomatic status to facilitate transport of this material, in violation of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (as well as US and Egyptian domestic laws). Johnson did not produce any documentation to support his claimed provenance. Nevertheless, the dealer paid in the region of $20,000 to Johnson for something like 80 pieces, and was subsequently able to sell them (without documented provenance) to other dealers and collectors around the world . In July 2008, Johnson pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of possession and selling of stolen antiquities . On 3 December, ICE returned 79 artifacts from Ma’adi to Egypt ."
"66.txt","Machaquilá is a Maya site located in an isolated part of Guatemala’s Petén department, about 45 km northeast of the site of Cancuén . The site is a difficult site to access due to rough terrain and a lack of natural resources . Its remote location appears to have buffered Machaquilá from the fallout of the endemic conflict of the Classic period, and the site experienced a brief florescence during 9th century AD in the wake of the Tikal-Calakmul Wars . Afterwards it fell into decline along with the rest of the Petén, although the people of Machaquilá produced stela for nearly 40 years after other sites were abandoned . Numerous sculpted stones were found by archaeologists at Machaquilá, for example, Ian Graham found 17 stelas and six altars in the 1960s, but as of the time of writing there are no carved monuments at the site . Many were looted during the endemic pillage of the Petén in the 1960s and 1970s and the rest were removed for their own protection by the Guatemalan government . Photo of Machaquilá Stela 2, provided by and used with the permission of MUNAE; the cuts made by looters to render the sculpture into transportable blocks are visible. Discovery of the site Two Costa Rican brothers working for the Union Oil Company discovered Machaquilá sometime before 1961. Archaeologist Ian Graham contacted the men and they confirmed their discovery by showing him a carved stone they had brought from the site that was being using as a doorstop . In May 1961 Graham visited Machaquilá, which he named after the local river, and recorded the presence of stelas. In 1962 he spent considerably more time at the site specifically to record the various carved stelas via photographs, drawings, and latex moulds . Thus, Machaquilá Stela 2 was discovered by Graham who drew and photographed the sculpture in situ, establishing that it was, indeed, in Guatemala after Guatemala had declared ownership of all archaeological objects within its territory. The Looting of Machaquila Stela 2 Unless otherwise stated, the following account of the trafficking of Machaquilá Stela 2 is derived from the memoirs of Ian Graham . In 1971, Dr. William Bullard of the University of Florida contacted Ian Graham to inform him that Machaquilá Stela 2 had been looted, trafficked, and exhibited for sale in Florida. The stela had been bought from looters (who cut it to pieces) by Jorge Alamilla, a Belizean who was known to be involved in the antiquities trade, for around $3,000 USD. It was passed on to three men: Ed Dwyer, according to Graham the brother-in-law of the owner of a lumber company that operated in the Petén; Johnnie Brown Fell; and Fell’s cousin Harry Brown, who were both in the shrimp-exporting business. The stela was stored in Fell’s fish-packing plant in Belize City for a period of time . The men moved the stela, which was in fragments, to Miami, Florida in a boat concealed by a shipment of shrimp. The fragments of the stela had been packed into boxes labelled ‘personal effects’ and marked with the address of restorer Clive Hollinshead in Santa Fe Springs, California . Once in Florida, Hollinshead was brought in to restore the piece. After the restoration, Fell and Dwyer bought a station wagon (Graham recounts that it was Fell and Alamilla, but the court record reports it was Dwyer), put the stela in it, and drove to New York City. They offered the stela to the Brooklyn Museum, to dealer André Emmerich, and then to dealer Leonardo Patterson (see: Maya Fresco Fake; El Manatí Wooden Olmec Busts; La Mina). All three declined to buy it, but Patterson suggested they offer the sculpture to Marjorie Neikrug who owned a gallery in the city. While Fell and Dwyer were discussing the piece with her, the car containing the stela was towed away for illegal parking but they managed to retrieve it. When Neikrug turned down the stela, the two men drove to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where they offered it to Glenn Rittenour, a Methodist minister who later testified against them at trial. He, too, turned the stela down. Federal records indicate the men also stopped in Decatur, Georgia, and in North Carolina in an attempt to sell the piece. Fell and Dwyer continued their drive, eventually bringing the stela to Los Angeles where they sold it to the restorer Clive Hollinshead. The asking price for the stela during this journey is said to have been $300,000 USD . After uncovering this story via a series of well-placed telephone calls, Graham contacted the FBI who informed him that the stela could be recovered via the National Stolen Property Act’s ban on the interstate transportation of stolen objects . Graham was told that at trial, it must be shown that the men in possession of the stela knew it was stolen and had transported the object from one state to another with full knowledge of this status. To secure this information, Graham asked a friend of his to pose as a potential buyer interested in Maya stelas. Hollinshead showed her Machaquilá Stela 2, which was in his garage at the time, proving that it had been transported, which provided enough evidence for the FBI to intervene. On August 28, 1972 a federal grand journey indicted Clive Hollinshead, Jorge Alamilla, and Johnnie Fell on charges of conspiracy to transport stolen goods in interstate and foreign commerce and causing the transportation of stolen property in interstate commerce . According to the indictment, Hollinshead had a prior arrangement with Alamilla for the procurement of looted and smuggled Maya objects. The indictment stated that Hollinshead was on-hand in Belize during the smuggling process, as were unnamed Guatemalan officials who were bribed . In February 1973, , who was serving as a witness, was unable to watch the majority of the trial. However, he recounts that Ed Dwyer, who was one of the original purchasers of the stela while it was still in Central America, turned state’s evidence and was spared any legal repercussions. Jorge Alamilla, who was not a US citizen, did not appear, presumably fleeing to his native Belize. The court found that Ted Wiener, a man based in Dallas and involved in the oil business, had financed Hollinshead’s purchase of the stela in return for a cut of any profit from resale. Hollinshead’s seized records showed that another stela from Machaquilá was, at that time, in the possession of Harry Brown in Helena, Arkansas, but that stela had been mostly destroyed in the looting process having been broken into 25 pieces. It was impounded by the FBI in January of 1972 and was later identified as Machaquilá Stela 5 . Allegedly this piece had been offered to the Denver Art Museum . On 14 March 1973, Hollinshead and Fell were found guilty of both counts and in 1974 the district court opinion was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeal for the 9th Circuit . Hollinshead was fined $5,000 USD, given a suspended sentence, and put on five years probation . Fell also received a suspended sentence and three years probation. Both Macahquilá Stela 2 and 5 were returned to Guatemala. A groundbreaking case? A controversial ruling? Some have cited ‘the beginning of American responsibility in dealing with the illicit traffic in plundered antiquities’ . However, the particulars of the case also signalled a clear need for further definition of issues related to international antiquities trafficking in US law. Hughes notes that a key aspect in the conviction of Hollinshead and Fell was that the objects in question were ‘stolen’. The men were charged with transport of stolen goods within the US. However, the original theft occurred in Guatemala and it was not against US law to commit a theft in Guatemala. Commentators wondered if an object that had been stolen in Guatemala should be considered ‘stolen’ within the US. In this case, the jury was instructed that the accused had to know that the stela was ‘stolen’, but the court declined to specify if the theft of the object had to occur within the US. In essence, the jury found that Hollinshead, as a restorer and dealer, must have known that the stela was ‘stolen’ in Guatemala, and thus found him guilty ."
"67.txt","Two 9th/10th century reliefs stolen from a temple in Rajasthan in 2009 and returned from the United States in early 2014. The town of Atru in east Rajasthan is home to 8 Hindu and Jain temples that date to the 9th and 10th centuries. These temples are now dilapidated and include a Vishnu temple which is known locally as “Gadgach” or “Disorderly Heap” . In 1905, the villages temples were described by (ASI) progress report, and the whole area was declared by the ASI to be of national importance and thus under its protection. In 2007 the ASI “decided to clear the scattered debris beneath the visible parts of Gadgach”, exposing the north side early plinth of the structure, which was decorated by, among other motifs, with four in situ maithunas . In Indian art, the concept of maithuna (spiritual transformation via either physical or metaphysical sexual union), is depicted in the form of couples entwined in embrace, referred to as “loving couples”. They are a popular motif in Indian art and largely due to the sexual nature of the iconography, are popular among collectors of Indian art on the international market. In 2009, two of the newly-exposed maithunas were stolen. On the night of 22/23 April, the western-most (farthest right) maithuna was stolen, potentially because it was the closest to the site’s gate . It weighed around 350 pounds . In response to the theft the ASI lodged a report of the crime with the police, but the report lacked a photograph of the missing piece. Four months later, on the night of 18/19 September 2009, the eastern-most (farthest left) maithuna was stolen, and again a report lacking a photograph was lodged with the police . It weighed around 400 pounds . In 2010 the second maithuna was pictured in an advertisement for the London-based dealer John Eskenazi on page 61 of the March-April issue of Arts of Asia. A Mr M. Postel, a French national with an interest in the art of Astru, recognized the piece and notified Mr Rajan Mathai, India’s ambassador to France . Meanwhile, Kirit L. Mankodi, who was present at the excavation of the maithuna in 2007, presented his own photographs of the missing statues and requested that the Indian High Commissions be alerted . Interpol then issued an alert for both missing maithunas. Meanwhile the advertised maithuna was shipped from London to New York where it was intercepted by US Homeland Security in April 2010. On 9 July 2012, Assistant District Attorney for Manhattan Matthew Bogdanos confirmed that both statues had been found in New York and that he expected repatriation to come soon. The two maithuna, as well as another stolen Indian piece, a 11th/12th century Bodhisattva from either Bihar or Bengal, were formally returned to India in early 2014. According to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the second maithuna had been transported from India to Hong Kong where it was sold to a dealer in Thailand and then re-sold to a buyer in London who shipped it to New York City for an exhibition held in March 2010. It was seized by Homeland Security on its way back to London. The first maithuna to be stolen had been transported from India to Hong Kong then sold to a buyer in New York, who sold it on to a buyer in Basel, Switzerland ."
"68.txt","Also known as: Colombian Gold Rush of 1992 & Hacienda Malagana Site of a massive looting incident which may have yielded over 200 kg of Colombian gold artifacts in 1992/1993. The Hacienda Malagana is located in the municipality of Palmira in Colombia‘s Cauca Valley, about twenty minutes from Cali. In late 1992 , the hacienda’s land was leased by Ingenio Providencia , a sugar company which used the property for growing sugarcane. One day the ground gave way underneath a farm worker who was driving a tractor through the cane field. The worker (and the tractor) fell into a pre-Conquest hypogeum and gold objects were clearly visible within the hole. These objects represented the work of a previously-unknown culture now referred to as the Malagana culture[1] who lived in region from approximately 300 BC to 300 AD. The farm worker removed and sold some of the gold objects from the tomb. This action did not go unnoticed by the local community and as many as 5,000 people descended upon the cane fields of Hacienda Malagana to loot the site in a scene likened to a ‘gold rush’. According to Colombian news sources, looting began at Hacienda Malagana on 28 December 1992 and authorities did not formally hear about the looting until 21 January 1993 .At least one person was murdered during the ‘gold rush’ and as much as 200 kg of gold artefacts were removed from the ground in a number of weeks. Hundreds of tombs were destroyed during the looting . The Colombian army was called to the hacienda in January 1993 and remained at the site for fifteen days. They were unable to secure the site and the units were eventually called to public order operations in other parts of the valley . Police units arrived on 9 March 1993 to try again to remove looters from the site. Police checkpoints were installed around the fifty hectare site, but they were not able to quell the looting . Rescue excavations were first attempted in March 1993 by archaeologists from the Instituto Vallecaucano de Investigaciones Científicas (INCIVA) and the Instituto Colombiano de Antropología (ICAN) . Four tombs were scientifically excavated at that time but archaeologists quickly abandoned the site due to the difficult security situation . Subsequent and extensive excavations conducted in 1994 clarified the occupational sequence of the site and confirmed that although the ancient people of Malagana conducted trade with other groups in the region, such as with the also heavily looted sites of San Agustín and Tierradentro, they had their own distinct iconographic style. Bogotá’s famous Museo del Oro, an offshoot of the Banco de la República, received a number of gold objects from Malagana as early as the latter part of 1992 according to some reports[2]. In an effort to recover as many objects from the looting as possible, over 150 pieces of Malagana gold were acquired by the museum. This decision has been criticised by some editorial pieces: the museum spent around 500 million pesos on objects that they knew to have come from looters . However, by combining first-hand accounts of the looting of individual tombs with information from the objects in their possession, the museum has been able to reconstruct the artefact assemblages of 29 graves from Malagana to some degree. This has provided limited contextual information for the artefacts. Although the Museo del Oro was able to buy many Malagana objects, an unknown number of artefacts left Colombia and entered the international art market. Two examples can be found in the collection of George Ortiz. One of the pieces in question is referred to on the website of the George Ortiz Collection as “267bis. Godzilla’s Realm”, presumably because the gold animal figure resembles a dinosaur (The George Ortiz Collection Website ). The catalogue entry for these objects openly records their findspot: ‘Provenance: El Bolo, Cauca Valley (Colombia) “Malagana” related to Calima Culture’ and ‘[t]he Pre-Columbian treasure of El Bolo is called the Malagana Culture after the hacienda where found’ (The George Ortiz Collection Website ). In an attempt to document some of the objects from Malagana that have not surfaced since they were removed from Malagana, the Universidad Nacional de Colombia’s Research Group on Human Factors and Ergonomics in Palmira has begun to collect images of lost artefacts. Although most of the pieces found by local looters were sold, many photographs of the objects are known to exist among the residents of El Bolo . The aim of this project is not only to record lost Malagana iconography, but also to use the designs from these objects to develop a line of products that the local community can market and thus “rescue the intrinsic value” of the culture . In other words, the project seeks to make the preservation of Malagana culture profitable to potential looters. Over 180 photographs of lost objects have been collected by researchers and these images have been displayed locally. The Hacienda Malagana and the area surrounding it still experiences incidences of looting. In 1999, the newspaper El Tiempo reported that as many as 100 to 300 looters could be found digging around the Hacienda Malagana on any given weekend . In February or March 2012, looters working in a cane field near the village of La Trocha located two pieces of Malagana figural ceramic. Locals reported that men from Palmira, presumably antiquities trafficking intermediaries, took the objects away . These objects were apparently found outside the protected area managed by the Fundación Cultura Malagana, again in a cane field ."

"7.txt","In the late 9th century CE, an Arab dhow ship carrying Chinese wares sunk off the coast of Belitung, an island off the eastern coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, in the Java Sea. The bottom of the vessel was torn out, possibly by a nearby reef, and the hull collapsed before there was time for sediment to build around it. The ship was most probably en route from China to the Middle East, where the Abbasid Dynasty had developed a taste for the ceramics developed during China’s Tang Dynasty . The ship contained 60,000 ceramics, 58,000 of which were Changsha ceramics from China’s Hunan Province . Foreign trade during the Tang Dynasty was so successful that in 723 AD, an imperial ban was decreed on the private transaction of copper and zinc to prevent a shortage of materials for currency production. Subsequently, the Tang Dynasty faced a need to perfect ceramic wares and glazes for everyday use . The development of stoneware pottery and porcelain, as well as glazes that did not contain toxic materials, revolutionised the production of everyday ceramics and created a dynamic new artistic tradition. Tang ceramics became the first real industrial-scale, mass-produced item that was shaped by market demand, not imperial funerary purposes. The technical evolution of Chinese ceramics encouraged the popularity of tea ceremonies as described by authors such as the poet Lu Yu in In Chajing or The Classic of Tea . The Changsha style of pottery is particularly notable for its tri-colour decoration and the lyrical abstraction of nature in its subjects. The Belitung shipwreck was discovered in 1998 by Indonesian fishermen diving for sea cucumbers, and the find was soon brought to the attention of the Republic of Indonesia. Although Indonesia recognized the significance of the wreck, it lacked the capacity to organize a professional excavation . Furthermore, Indonesia does not recognise the UNESCO 2001 Convention on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage, which condemns the unscientific excavation of underwater archaeological sites by commercial salvagers or looters. Through its National Committee for Salvage and Utilization of Valuable Cargo Objects from Sunken Ships, the Indonesian government turned to commercial salvaging company Seabed Explorations, led by German director Tilman Walterfang . The ten fishing families that lived closest to the wreck were of divided opinion over this decision. Some supported the commercial salvage of the wreck because it brought money into the community. Others were in favour of supporting French divers who were raising objects from the wreck without a license. In the end, the community elders recommended allowing Seabed Explorations to excavate the wreck because they were fully licensed and had financial resources that they believed would feed back into the community . The salvage effort began almost immediately after the shipwreck’s discovery and continued over two seasons. Each season was led by a different archaeologist: the first remains unnamed by Walterfang due to a scandal that resulted in his removal; the second was Southeast Asian underwater specialist Dr Michael Flecker. Though both laid grids of the wreck site, no records have been made available to determine which objects came from which grid. After the cargo was salvaged, Walterfang obtained licenses from the Indonesian government to have the collected objects exported to conservation facilities in Germany and New Zealand. He then commissioned a group of international scholars to analyse the finds, which resulted in two major studies. Neither has been published, but parts of both were used in future publications, particularly the Shipwrecked: Tang Treasures and Monsoon Winds exhibition catalogue. Dedicated to keeping the collection intact as opposed to selling objects individually, Walterfang sold the collection for $32 million USD in 2005 to the Sentosa Leisure Group, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Sentosa Development Corporation, an entity established by the government of Singapore. The Sentosa Development Corporation established a long-term loan agreement with the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and that same year, the STB teamed up with the Asian Civilizations Museum in Singapore to display highlights from the collection in an exhibition titled, ‘Tang Treasures from the Sea’. The importance of the Belitung shipwreck was broadcast to audiences outside of academia: in June 2009, The National Geographic featured the shipwreck in its magazine and in a documentary titled ‘Secrets of the Tang Treasure Ship’ . That same year, Victor Mair, author and professor of Chinese languages and literature at the University of Pennsylvania, discussed the significance of the Belitung find in his book, The True History of Tea. In 2007, Julian Raby, the director of the Smithsonian Institution’s Freer/Sackler Galleries, was approached by the Singapore Tourism Board’s Pamelia Lee about organizing an exhibition of the shipwreck and putting together a book. The project began officially in December 2009 and Raby took it on with no reservations. Because the salvage had been legal under Indonesian law and the collection had been kept intact, he did not anticipate any backlash. The exhibition catalogue was published in conjunction with the Singapore Tourism Board and Singapore National Heritage Board (NHB) in time for Shipwrecked: Tang Treasures and Monsoon Winds to open on 19 February 2011 . Soon after, the Sackler Gallery announced that it would also exhibit Shipwrecked the following year on the exhibition’s worldwide tour. This news sparked an internal debate within the Smithsonian. When archaeologists in other museum departments heard that an exhibition of unscientifically excavated, commercially exploited artefact was so far along, they began internal processes through the Smithsonian Congress of Scholars to communicate their concern. The chief complaint was that by continuing the exhibition, the Smithsonian would violate various organizational ethics that prohibit the display of artefacts that have been excavated without proper scientific methods. The American Association of Museums ethical guidelines was the chief document listed that the Sackler had allegedly violated. Additionally, though the United States has not ratified the UNESCO 2001 Convention, it was expected that the Smithsonian would adhere to the spirit of the Convention . Although Dr Michael Flecker describes himself as an archaeologist, he is not recognised as a proper archaeologist by his Western colleagues due to his lack of formal training by Western standards, as well as his willingness to work with salvagers. Although there was a great deal of attention given to the historical significance of the shipwreck throughout the excavation, Flecker did not adhere to Western archaeological standards of recovery. This caused concern within the Smithsonian archaeological community that by exhibiting the shipwreck artefacts, the Smithsonian would be seen as condoning the commercial exploitation of unscientifically excavated objects . When internal memos from the Smithsonian were leaked to Science Magazine, the debate was covered in publications such as The New York Times and NPR as well. Raby organized two meetings with Smithsonian staffers and outside experts to determine whether the exhibition should continue at the Sackler and if so, how it should be approached. Ultimately, it was unanimously decided that in lieu of holding the exhibition, the Smithsonian would instead propose a re-excavation of the Belitung shipwreck site to the Republic of Indonesia. Though this meeting was a rare success in building cooperation between an art museum and archaeologists, the decision to cancel the exhibition was followed by outrage and disappointment in Singapore and Indonesia as they perceived a great snub in the rejection of the exhibition . The contents of the shipwreck remain in Singapore. The shipwreck site was surveyed by an Indonesian team in 2011, and there is film footage of what remains of the hull on YouTube . As of this writing, no details have yet been made public on the plan to re-excavate."
"70.txt","Marion True was appointed curatorial assistant at the J. Paul Getty Museum in 1982, under the supervision of Jiri Frel, the then Curator of Antiquities. After Frel’s departure in 1986, True was promoted to replace him as curator . During the period of her curatorship, True was responsible for some controversial acquisitions of unprovenanced material, including the 1988 purchase of the Getty Aphrodite, the 1993 purchase of a fourth-century BC gold funerary wreath from Greece, and the 1996 acquisition of the Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman Collection. She also rejected some potentially high-profile assemblages, including the Kanakaria mosaics in 1988, which she recognized as stolen , and the Sevso Treasure, when she discovered that the accompanying documents of provenance were probably forgeries . She was prepared to return material to its country of origin if it was shown convincingly to have an illicit provenance, including several hundred ceramic fragments acquired by donation between 1979 and 1981, that in 1994 were found to have been looted from a sanctuary at Francavilla Maritima in Italy . True was the driving force behind the Getty’s adoption of clear policy guidelines as regards its acquisition of unprovenanced antiquities. The first version, in 1987, which was believed at the time by True to be the only policy of its kind in place at a major collecting museum, required the Getty to notify in writing the appropriate authority of a possible country of origin about a potential acquisition, and request information about theft or illegal export. The acquisition would only proceed if no such information was forthcoming. Furthermore, if at any time after acquisition a country could make a verifiable claim of theft or illegal export, the Getty would return the object in question, notwithstanding any legal protection offered by a statute of limitations . This policy was strengthened in November 1995 by the assurance that an unprovenanced object would only be acquired if it had been published or otherwise publicly documented as out of its country of origin prior to November 1995 . This requirement for public documentation was intended to protect against forged provenances, which True believed were rife in the antiquities trade . Several pieces were returned in accordance with the policy . Nevertheless, the sincerity of the Getty’s motives was called into question by the 1996 acquisition of the Fleischman Collection, comprising largely unprovenanced material, which had been published only in 1994 by the Getty itself. True was offered the position of Curator of Greek and Roman Art at the Metropolitan Museum in New York in 1991 after Dietrich von Bothmer’s retirement the year before, but declined the offer when she was presented with the opportunity to oversee the projected renovation and redesign of the Getty Villa in Malibu, which was to house the Getty’s antiquities collection . The project cost $275 million and the Villa reopened in January 2006 . True suggested that the 1995 revision of the acquisitions policy was part of a larger change in mission occasioned by this reimagining of the Getty Villa, which envisaged a shift in primary purpose for the museum from collecting antiquities to conservation abroad and incoming loan exhibitions . In 1995, True bought a house on the Greek island of Paros with the help of a four-year loan of $400,000 from Christos Michaelides, partner of antiquities dealer Robin Symes, from whom the Getty had bought several important pieces, including the Aphrodite . Just days after the acquisition of the Fleischman Collection in 1996, she paid back Michaelides with money borrowed from the Fleischmans on a twenty-year mortgage . When these loans came to the attention of the Getty trustees in September 2005, True was fired for failing to declare them in contravention of the Getty’s conflict-of-interest policy . On 1 April 2005, a few months before her dismissal, True was charged in Italy with receiving stolen antiquities and conspiring with dealers Robert Hecht and Giacomo Medici to receive stolen antiquities, and she was ordered to stand trial in Rome . The case against True had materialized as Italian investigators working through photographic and documentary material seized from Medici’s Geneva storerooms began to suspect her involvement. It was quickly recognized that True had acquired a fifth-century BC bronze tripod and candelabrum for the Getty in 1990 that had been stolen from the long established Guglielmo Collection in Italy . Letters were also discovered revealing what appeared to be friendly relations between True, Medici and Hecht . Finally, there was a set of photographs recording forty-two objects that had passed through the hands of Medici before ultimately being acquired by the Getty . The investigators also came to believe that prior to 1996 True had been encouraging the Fleischmans to buy objects of dubious provenance in the knowledge that they would ultimately be donated to the Getty—in effect, using the Fleischman Collection to launder potentially illicit material . True argued in her defence that staying on good terms with antiquities dealers was a professional requirement of her position as curator , that she had not acquired objects for her own benefit, but for the museum, and that she should not take sole responsibility for acquisitions made during her tenure as curator, as they had all been made with the approval of the Getty CEO , Director , in-house counsel, and Board of Trustees . This statement was supported by internal Getty documentation . Indeed, many of the objects in the photographs seized at Medici’s storerooms had been acquired before True was curator . Both True and Barbara Fleischman rejected out of hand any imputation of collusion . The trial commenced on 16 November 2005, and was abandoned without verdict on 13 October 2010 as the limitation period on True’s alleged offences expired . True complained that she had been ‘neither condemned nor vindicated’ . In November 2006, Greek prosecutors charged True in connection with the fourth-century BC gold funerary wreath acquired in 1993, which was by then believed to have been taken out of Greece illegally . In November 2007, her trial was ended without resolution after the expiry of the statute of limitations ."
"71.txt","Antiquities dealer Leonardo Patterson convicted of federal wire fraud for attempting to sell a fake Maya ‘fresco’ In May 1984 antiquities dealer Leonardo Patterson (associated with the La Mina headdress case and the El Manatí Olmec Busts case) was arrested by the US FBI in Boston on accusations of fraud . Earlier that year, Patterson had attempted to sell what he claimed was a small Maya ‘fresco’ to Wayne Anderson. According to the affidavit, Patterson originally offered the fresco to Anderson for $250,000 but, during a telephone conversation, he indicated that he would sell the piece for $100,000 if he received a down payment of $35,000 by 1 May 1984 . Patterson allegedly told Anderson that the work had been authenticated by Donald Hales, a California-based Maya researcher who was associated with some of the original publications of Maya vases that would go on to form the November Collection. Hales denies that he authenticated the piece. Patterson also allegedly claimed the piece had been authenticated by the North Carolina-based art appraiser, Paul Clifford. Clifford was one of three valuers who went to Australia to assess a collection of Precolumbian pieces imported by Patterson and donated to the Victoria National Gallery in a famous non-criminal tax break loophole scheme . Clifford was not implicated in any specific wrongdoing in that case. According to Hales, Patterson brought him to Switzerland to authenticate a group of five Maya ‘frescos’ in a Swiss collection, but the piece offered to Anderson was not one of these . However, Patterson offered the piece in question with a photocopy of Hales’ alleged authentication document. Following the arrest of Patterson and the seizure of the ‘fresco’, the piece was sent to archaeologist and art historian Clemency Coggins who determined it was a fake rendered in acrylic paint . Archaeologist Ian Graham also inspected the ‘fresco’. He described it as: ‘a perfectly obvious fake, crude in execution, done with impossible pigments, and on closer inspection, the end of a thick nylon filament was sticking out from the mural’s surface’ . Because Patterson attempted to make this sale via the telephone, he was charged with federal wire fraud. He was convicted and sentenced to probation . While still on probation, Patterson was arrested in Dallas-Fort Worth airport where he was found to be in possession of an undeclared Precolumbian figurine and 36 endangered sea turtle eggs and was sentenced to a year in prison on smuggling charges . Patterson has since been convicted of fraud in Germany for the sale of a fake monumental Olmec head ."
"72.txt","Two pre-Columbian antiquities offered for sale by Sotheby’s New York in 1994, were later found in photographs taken by an admitted artifact looter and smuggler. In 1995 a self-confessed looter and pre-Columbian antiquities smuggler named Val Edwards provided authorities and the New York Times with fantastic details of a decade’s worth of trafficking in Latin American cultural property. He claimed that he had been cheated by his partners and was no longer interested in a life of crime . As part of a negotiated plea deal for reduced sentencing for his admitted false declarations to US Customs, Edwards claimed that he had illegally imported over 1000 artefacts into the United States . To support these claims, he provided a number of photographs that appeared to show pre-Columbian antiquities in various hotel rooms. Edwards said he smuggled these antiquities into the United States and delivered to a ‘Latin American entrepreneur’ in New York . Among these photographs were several that showed a monumental figure in the form of a Maya priest and others that showed a large brazier. It was soon noticed that both of these items appeared to match lots offered in Sotheby’s 15 November 1994 sale of pre-Columbian objects. When shown the auction catalogue and Edwards’ photos, archaeologist Ian Graham concluded they were identical: ‘There’s no question about it. Although the figure of a priest has been greatly restored, there are tiny discolorations and nicks which correspond exactly’ . Neither the brazier nor the figure achieved their respective reserve prices at the auction and both were returned to their consignor . This was the same sale in which several items looted from the Peruvian site of Sipán were offered and sold . The large brazier. When contacted by the New York Times, long-time head of Sotheby’s pre-Columbian department Stacy Goodman initially refused to reveal who consigned the objects, stating only that a European collector offered them for sale. Eventually she admitted that the pieces were consigned by Leonardo Patterson, a Costa Rican antiquities dealer then living in Munich . Patterson was a well known figure in the antiquities world. He was implicated in an Australian tax loophole scheme involving antiquities in 1981, convicted of federal wire fraud in 1984 concerning a fake Maya mural he attempted to sell, and was sentenced to a year in prison in 1985 for illegally importing antiquities and rare turtle eggs into the United States. Nonetheless, and although she had been in charge of pre-Columbian objects at a major auction house for a decade at that point, Goodman told the New York Times that she was unaware that Patterson had a history of problems with the law . She stated that she had researched the objects and that she considered her research to be sufficient, stating ‘We do make mistakes….We could not stay in business if I interrogated our clients’ . She noted that clients are obligated to sign a warranty stating that they have no reason to believe that the object being consigned was illegally imported. When asked about the allegations made by Edwards, Patterson stated through his lawyer that he had traveled with Edwards for years but not for the purposes of committing any crimes. He also stated that the photo of the brazier had been taken years ago in Europe, not the United States, as by 1995 he had possessed the object for over 30 years . Patterson’s lawyer provided the New York Times with a taped phone conversation between Edwards and his client which allegedly recorded Edwards offering to keep Patterson out of the New York Times for ‘25 big ones’. Edwards claimed that the tapes had been edited and that Patterson had tried to bribe him, an accusation that Patterson’s lawyer denied ."
"73.txt","Distinctive pottery style from the south western United States; all known Mimbres cultural sites have been looted. ‘Mimbres’ is the term used to designate a sub region of the Mogollon cultural tradition centred on the Mimbres and Rio Grande Valleys of the Arizona/New Mexico border region. The ‘Classic Mimbres’ phase, which spanned from approximately 1000 to 1150 AD, is particularly known for its distinctive pottery. The Classic Mimbres pottery tradition is characterised by painted bowls decorated with geometric and figural designs in black on a white ground. The bowls are usually found in human burials and appear to be used to cover the face or head of the deceased. They often have a distinctive ‘kill hole’, an intentional puncture at the base of the bowl which appears to be associated with this ceremonial function. Early Archaeology and Subsequent Looting Mimbres sites have been known to archaeologists since the 1880s, however Classic Mimbres pottery was not described until the 1910s when J. Walter Fewkes of the Smithsonian Institution was shown some pieces by a local collector . His reconnaissance survey of the area produced the collections of Mimbres pottery that were transported to the Smithsonian and the Museum of the American Indian in New York. Excavations conducted in the 1920s and 1930s produced most of the other museum collections of Mimbres pieces . Archaeological excavations ceased at Mimbres during the Great Depression and a lack of formal archaeological oversight in the region led to nearly four decades of major looting. Not a single Mimbres cultural site escaped being looted . In the 1960s looters began to use heavy machinery and earth movers to reach painted bowls more quickly. Because of this many Mimbres sites have been completely obliterated . Archaeological Publications Inspiring a Market Mimbres presents an interesting case for how archaeologists might inadvertently stimulate demand for cultural property. In 1977, , the former professor of Art History and Anthropology at the University of New Mexico and former director of the Maxwell Museum, released the popular volume Mimbres Painted Pottery . Nearly three decades later, in the introduction to the revised edition of this book, Brody recounts that although he did not anticipate his book having an effect on the antiquities market, he believes that the book’s popularity directly contributed to the increase in looting of Mimbres sites in the 1970s and onwards . The privately owned vessels pictured in Brody’s book experienced a sharp increase in their market value. They were, by association with Brody, ‘authenticated’ and they became ‘desirable trophies’ among collectors . Brody records that he fears lawsuits if he refers to any privately owned Mimbres vessel as being ‘fake’, but now assumes that ‘any vessel that has neither provenience nor a solid provenance is either fake or so altered that it might as well be one’ . So as to not contribute further to ‘an art marketplace that is childishly easy to manipulate’, the newest edition of Mimbres Painted Pottery only contains images of vessels in publicly owned collections . Many Mimbres sites fall into the legal grey area that exists in the United States concerning public vs. private land. While looting on public land is prohibited under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) , and the disturbance of Native American burials on public land is a violation of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), looting on private land is less clearly regulated. It is simply harder to protect privately owned Mimbres sites from looting. In response to this situation, archaeologist Steven LeBlanc started the Mimbres Foundation at the University of New Mexico. This organisation used private contributions to buy privately owned Mimbres sites with the hopes of preserving them. Because The Mimbres Foundation was the legal landowner of these sites, they were able to prohibit looting activities by not granting looters access to the remains. Case Study: The East Fork Site and the Quarrell Conviction As a case study, the Mimbres site of East Fork is located on the Mimbres River within New Mexico’s Gila National Forrest. In February 2000, officers from the USDA Forest Service noticed evidence of illicit digging at the site and set up seismic sensors near the site’s access trail in hopes of detecting a looting operation . Early in the morning on the 23rd of February the sensors were tripped and officers responded. They found brothers James and Mike Quarrel and nephew Aaron Sera digging at the site with shovels and picks . As the looting occurred on federal land the case was heard by the federal court in La Cruces, New Mexico. Sera pled guilty to misdemeanour charges but the Quarrell brothers faced felony charges under ARPA. These stemmed from the monetary assessment of the damage to the site. Causing damages in excess of $500 is classified as a felony under ARPA. Although the Quarrells admitted that they were trespassing (a misdemeanour), they argued that they had only just arrived at East Fork when they were caught, that they had only engaged in surface collection, and that the damage visible at the site was the work of other looters . After a short deliberation a jury declared the Quarrells guilty on all counts. They were sentenced to concurrent jail terms of a year and a day followed by a year of probation. They were each ordered to pay $4,362 for the restoration of the East Fork site and $15,253 as restitution for the damage that they caused . In 2002 the Quarrells appealed their conviction, arguing that the government did not prove that the defendants knew they were on public land and that the defendants were not permitted to present a defence based on a belief that they were excavating on private land . The court ruled that under ARPA the government did not need to prove that the defendants knew they were excavating on public land. The court agreed that a defendant should be able to mount a defence based on their belief that they were legally excavating on private land, but that ‘the defendant must establish that he reasonably believed he was lawfully excavating on private land because such “an honest mistake of fact would not be consistent with criminal intent”[…] However, if a defendant merely argues that he thought he was excavating on private land, such a mistake of fact would not negate criminal intent because such conduct is unlawful’ . In other words, the Quarrells had no reason to think that they were excavating lawfully on private property so such a defence could not apply in their case. The court did declare the $15,253 restitution order to be an abuse of discretion but upheld the $4,362 for site repairs. What is interesting about the Quarrell appeal on the grounds that they didn’t know that they were on federal land is that in October of 1975 Mike Quarrell (along with Charles and Frank Quarrell, family relationship unclear) was arrested for looting a different Mimbres site also within the Gila National Forrest . Mike and Charles Quarrell were charged with violating the Antiquities Act and were tried before a United States Magistrate in Las Cruces, New Mexico in May of 1976. They were found guilty and sentenced to 40 hours of community service and 1 year of probation ."
"74.txt","Also known as: Argenti di Morgantina, Hellenistic Silver & Morgantina Treasure A silver hoard removed from the Sicilian site of Morgantina by looters around in 1979/80 which was eventually purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The Hellenistic settlement of Morgantina was founded around 1000 BC , part of the ancient Kingdom of Syracuse . It is in central Sicily, close to the modern town of Aidone, however its exact location was lost for many years. Morgantina declined rapidly after supporting, Carthage in the Second Punic War in 211 BC . The exact location of the city was then not rediscovered until 1955, when archaeologists from Princeton University found various artefacts and remains including a die marked ‘MGT’ for Morgantina; the first evidence to emerge of the settlement’s location . For years the excavations have continued at Morgantina, led by American universities including Princeton University but later also the University of Virginia and Wesleyan University , but always with an awareness that tombaroli were also at work. It is believed that in around 1979-1980, the Morgantina silver, sometimes referred to as the Morgantina Treasure , was removed from the site by looters possibly using metal detectors . The silver, consisting of 16 pieces including two small silver horns and an emblem depicting the sea monster Scylla in sculptural relief , was then probably smuggled into Switzerland in around 1981 . The New York Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the silver in two lots over 1981 and 1982 from the antiquities dealer Robert Hecht, for a total sum of $2.7 million . The chain of events leading from the looting of the silver from Morgantina to its acquisition by the Met has been summarised by Peter Watson and Cecilia Todeschini , based on information received from the Carabinieri Art Squad: “The route was as follows: Vincenzo Bossi and Filippo Baviera, tombaroli in Enna, sold the silver for 110 million lire to Orazio Di Simone, a Sicilian middleman based in Lugano in Switzerland, who sold it for $875,000 to Robert Hecht, who sold the silver to the Metropolitan Museum for $3 million[1].” In 1984 Dietrich von Bothmer, the Met’s curator also connected with the acquisition of the Euphronios Krater , gave the silver preliminary publication in the museum’s Bulletin , with only vague details as to its possible provenance . The first of several proposals to return the silver was made four years later in 1988 when the provenience of the silver had been identified as Sicily . This was the year after Malcolm Bell, the university archaeologist in charge of ongoing excavations at Morgantina, had first seen the silver pieces on display in the Met and wrote to the museum explaining his suspicions that the artefacts had originated in Morgantina . In the following years, Bell made several requests to view the silver, the first being in 1993, which was refused by the Met ; such a refusal of a request from a serious scholar being considered “almost unheard of” . Evidence given by local tombaroli including Giuseppe Mascara , who was arrested in 1996 and disclosed information about the looting of the Morgantina silver in an attempt to shorten his sentence , included the alleged find spot of the silver . This led to a further representation to the Met by the Italian government using the testimony gathered from the tombaroli. However, the Met’s executive vice president, Ashton Hawkins, “informed the Italians that the museum could not rely on the word of a convicted looter trying to reduce his sentence” . Meanwhile, the Italian government had in the same year asked Bell to carry out investigations to attempt to pinpoint the site of the looting , and in 1997 and 1998 excavations were carried out by Bell and the US expedition to Morgantina at “the Greek house where the treasure was originally found” . The team discovered in the floor of the house two holes that corresponded with the size of the hoard as purchased by the Met, including in one of the holes a 1978 Italian coin that helped support the suggested date of the looting . That the Met purchased the silver in two lots seemed to support the suggestion that the treasure was found on two different occasions, resulting in the two separate holes that were discovered by the excavation . Also discovered was a bronze coin that was minted between 214 and 212 BC, which corresponded to the date when Morgantina was known to have been attacked and would support the notion that the silver may have been concealed around this time so as to avoid its theft or destruction during the conflict . In 1999, Bell was finally permitted to view the Morgantina silver at the Met, and was convinced of the true provenance of the hoard, to the extent of translating the Greek inscription found on two of the vessels as ‘of Eupolemos’, a name already associated with Morgantina from other data found at the site . This differed from the Met’s own translation by von Bothmer of the inscription as ‘from the war’; a term almost identical to the possessive of Eupolemos in the Ancient Greek . It took several more years for the Italian government and the Met to reach an agreement with regard to the final destination of the Morgantina silver, with Philippe de Montebello, then the director of the Met suggesting in a letter in 2003 to Giuliano Urbani, then the Italian Culture Minister, “that the museum might be willing to cede title to the 15 pieces of silver if it were allowed to keep the set for 25 more years” . It was not until 2006 that an agreement was finally reached, which covered other repatriation claims as well as the Morgantina silver, including the Euphronios Krater, a Laconian kylix and three examples of red-figured pottery . The agreement, signed on the 21 February 2006, allowed for the Morgantina silver to remain in New York on loan and on display until January 2010 , but also for the Met to be provided with loans of ‘comparably great works of ancient art’ from Italy for its displays. Upon returning to Italy, the Morgantina silver went on display in Rome , then Palermo , and finally the museum in Aidone. Aidone is expected to benefit economically from the recent repatriation not only of the Morgantina silver, but also of two acrolithic sculptures formerly in the possession of collector Maurice Tempelsman, and the ‘Getty Aphrodite’; all three of which sculptures are believed also to have been looted from Morgantina ."
"75.txt","Mosaic stone mask said to have been looted from a Mexican cave and now in the collection of Dumbarton Oaks. In 1966 Mildred Barns Bliss, the widow of a former diplomat Robert Woods Bliss and cofounder, along with her late husband, of the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington DC, purchased what purported to be a Maya mosaic mask. The story of how it was looted and moved into the US is considered by many to be unbelievable. An unbelievable story According to Coe and Meyer , a Mexican antiquities collector named Dr. Josué Sáenz was contacted by an unknown caller who called himself ‘Gonzáles’. Gonzáles called three times and demanded that Sáenz take the first flight to Villahermosa, Tabasco . There Sáenz was met by strangers who convinced him to get into a small plane, the compass of which was covered with a cloth . They eventually landed on a remote airstrip in the foothills of the Sierra de Chiapas where a group of villagers came forward with looted antiquities. According to Coe , the villagers showed Sáenz the Grolier Codex, the mosaic mask, and some other pieces. Meyer states that Sáenz asked to take the antiquities back to Mexico City to have them authenticated but that the villagers refused, saying that he had to make his decision right there (Coe states that Sáenz was able to take the pieces to his authenticator). Sáenz offered the villagers $2,000 but they produced a Parke-Bernet auction catalogue and indicated they knew the US sale value of Mexican antiquities . Sáenz then wrote a post-dated cheque for a higher amount and possession of the mask (and, perhaps, the Grolier Codex) was transferred. According to Meyer , when Sáenz showed the mask to José Luis Franco, the art expert and authenticator felt that it was probably a fake. Based on Franco’s opinion, Sáenz allegedly put a stop purchase order on his cheque for the piece but found it had already been cashed. Sáenz then turned the mask over to a dealer he worked with, instructing the dealer to sell it with no guarantee of authenticity. The dealer then sold the piece on to a New York-based dealer that Meyer calls ‘George Alpha’, identified here as Alphonse Jax . The piece was moved into the United States. Questions about the authenticity of the mask remained. Jax allegedly showed the piece to Dr. Gordon Ekholm, the curator of Mexican archaeology at the American Museum of Natural History . Ekholm examined the mask under a microscope and found what he believed to be evidence that a beard had once been attached to the mask, a detail that he felt forgers would not include. According to Meyer, Ekholm’s declaration that the mask was genuine “considerably enhanced the value of the mask” . The mask is now widely considered to be genuine. At this point the mask was sold to Bliss. Connection to the Grolier Codex Although Coe has published that the mask and the Grolier codex were found together and were both part of the uncorroborated story of Sáenz in a small plane in the jungle, there is little solid evidence to support this. The codex itself was first seen in New York in 1971 in an exhibition organized by Coe and the small plane and mysterious cave are not mentioned anywhere in the literature associated with the piece at that time. When Coe was contacted by Meyer and asked where the codex came from, Coe would only say that ‘the codex was a “real hot potato” lent to the Grolier Club by an anonymous owner’ and would say no more on the matter . Meyer states that a few months after the display of the codex, “George Alpha” (identified here as Jax), told him that the codex was genuine. He said that the piece had been found in a wooden box as part of a funerary group that included the mosaic mask, but that the piece had not passed through his hands . Meyer believed that his source was telling the truth. It is interesting to note that the pieces do share some qualities. First, the authenticity of both pieces has been hotly debated. Second, if real, they would both date to the Maya late Post Classic period. Third, they are both tied, in some way, to collector Josué Sáenz whose story about how one or both of those pieces came into his possession strikes many as far-fetched. Because it is unknown if the mask and the codex were found together, and because the pieces were looted, we have lost the opportunity to study what may have been an entirely unique Maya funerary context."
"76.txt","Five elaborately carved panels that were smuggled, sold, (almost) used to pay a kidnapping ransom, subject to a landmark court case, and were returned to New Zealand in 2014. Hiding the Panels In 1819, the Ngā Puhi iwi, armed with European muskets, began a campaign against the other iwis of the North Island of New Zealand. Te Āti Awa iwi, which is ancestrally based in the Taranaki region, aligned themselves with Ngā Puhi against the Waikato iwi and won a major battle at Te Motu Nui (Motunui) in 1822. However, Waikato forces threatened to take the region, which forced four major migrations of Ngā Puhi-aligned peoples southward out of Taranaki. During times of danger, usually impending raid, it was not uncommon for Māori groups to hide important panels and other carved works in nearby swamps . This practice served to protect these powerful and important pieces from being taken by enemies. At some point, either during the migrations southward following the battle at Motunui or in the lead up to the battle itself, a group of elaborate carved wooden panels, known to have been made before 1830, as well as other important ritual objects were deposited in a swampy area near Motunui. These panels were likely both created and deposited by Te Āti Awa. Many of the panels are thought to have lined the walls of a pātaka, a storehouse on stilts or a pole that was used to keep preserved food safe from rats (Te Ara ). Both the outsides and the insides of pātaka were often decorated with elaborate carvings. Master carver Rangi Kipa explained that the reason that pātaka carvings were so elaborate was because of the importance of the structures: they essentially housed the collective wealth of the whole community in the form of provisions . It is unknown why the pātaka panels and other hidden objects were never recovered by Te Āti Awa. During the unrest in Taranaki during this period, there was a significant amount of disruption of Māori life and living situations and thus many reasons why deposited carved pieces were not retrieved. Dansey postulates that knowledge of the panels buried at Motunui was either lost by the Māori who eventually returned to the area following their displacement, or that upon return, tensions with Europeans were such that it was considered best to leave the pieces where they were. No oral or written account exists of the deposition of the panels at Motuni . Re-discovery of the panels On 19 January 1960, J. ’Scotty’ Kilpatrick and Maurice Topine were draining a swamp near the corner of SH3 and Otaraoa Road, Motunui, Taranaki when their ditch digger caught on a large piece of wood . The men were working on the property of a Mr. , only two miles from where a group of archaeologists were excavating at the time{1} . Their find turned out to be a Māori carved panel, thought to come from a pātaka, hidden during the displacements of the 1800s . Luckily the ditch digger wrenched the panel from the mud intact and it landed, with only minor damage, on the side of the ditch . Kilpatrick and Topine immediately contacted authorities at the Taranaki Museum in New Plymouth (now called Puke Ariki) and the piece, now referred to as the Ngati Rahiri Taonga, has remained in that museum ever since . A number of other panels and related finds were located both by members of the public and by archaeological excavations in the area. It is clear that the area was extensively occupied in the lead-up to the panels’ abandonment and that it was also the site of a major hiding event of cultural property that was meant to eventually be recovered by the Te Āti Awa. In 1972 another chance find was made near the site of the first panel discovery in Motunui. A man, named in subsequent legal proceedings as simply ‘Manukonga’ and described as a ‘Maori tribesman’ , was reportedly cutting a path through the swamp when he encountered another carved wooden panel. He would go on to recover five panels from this location, the tallest being approximately 1.5 m high . These panels are thought to be associated with the 1960 panel and may have been part of the same hiding event. Puke Ariki taonga curator Glen Skipper has noted that the carving styles of the 1960 and 1972 pieces appear similar, implying that they may have been carved by the same artist . It is thought that the 5 panels discovered in 1972 would have formed the back wall of the pātaka . Trafficking and sale ‘Manukonga’ reportedly brought the panels to his home and the next year an English antiquities dealer named Lance Entwistle{2} viewed them there. Entwistle then bought the panels from ‘Manukonga’ for $6000 NZD . The dealer then removed the pieces from New Zealand, in an act which according to the New Zealand Government was in violation of the law , taking them to New York via Auckland . Specifically Entwistle exported them without applying for a permit to do so under the stipulations of the 1962 New Zealand Historic Articles Act . Entwistle contacted antiquities collector George Ortiz, who visited New York to view the panels . Entwistle allegedly told him that although the pieces had been exported from New Zealand without a permit, he was the owner of the objects and thus could sell them to Ortiz. According to members of the New Zealand government, Entwistle also offered provenance documents with the sale that were falsified . On 23 April 1973 Ortiz purchased the five panels for $65,000 USD and sent them to his home in Geneva by air . As a stipulation of the sale Ortiz was not allowed to show the panels to New Zealand archaeologists for two years and was not allowed to give photographs of the panels to any third party . Attorney-General of New Zealand v Ortiz Although the New Zealand government made attempts to have the panels returned in 1978, 1983, 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2007 , the first attempt is the most well-known. In 1978, five years after the purchase of the panels and thus outside of the 2 year period he was not allow to share images of the panels, Ortiz consigned and shipped the panels to London for a 29 June sale at Sotheby’s to raise money after having paid a ransom for his kidnapped 6-year-old daughter Graziella . Graziella was returned after Ortiz gave the kidnappers $2 million USD, but the financial loss led Ortiz to consign 234 items for auction under the title “The George Ortiz Collection of Primitive Works of Art” . After the panels were consigned to Sotheby’s, were valued at £300,000, and the catalogue was published, the Government of New Zealand formally sought their return, issuing a writ claiming ownership on 26 June 1978, three days before the sale . In response, the panels were withdrawn from the sale pending judgment. As the sale of the other items fetched $2.9 million USD, enough to pay for Graziella’s ransom, Ortiz indicated that he no longer wanted to sell the panels . In a 1982 case before the House of Lords to determine several preliminary issues, the Lords ruled that New Zealand’s Historic Articles Act of 1962 and the Customs Acts of 1913 and 1966 did not automatically vest the Crown with title to illegally exported artefacts . Of specific concern was Section 12 of the 1962 act: An historic article knowingly exported or attempted to be exported in breach of this Act shall be forfeited to Her Majesty and, subject to the provisions of this Act, the provisions of the Customs Act 1913 relating to forfeited goods shall apply to any such article in the same manner as they apply to goods forfeited under the Customs Act 1913 New Zealand argued, as Lord Denning paraphrased, that their 1962 act should be read as: An historic article which has been knowingly exported from New Zealand in breach of this act shall be automatically forfeited to her Majesty, and Her Majesty can recover it in any other country into which it may be imported an interpretation that Lord Denning believed infringed on various aspects of international law. The Lords determined that the Crown only acquired title if the object was seized, not if it was only illegally exported . In the subsequent appeal, Attorney-General of New Zealand v Ortiz [1984], Lords Fraser, Scarman, Roskill, Brandon and Brightman determined that New Zealand’s claim should fail on the grounds that to return the panels would constitute enforcing foreign law (the previously-mentioned Historic Articles Act) in the UK (New Zealand ) and the appeal was dismissed. 2014 Return after Ortiz’ death In 2013 George Ortiz died and in March of 2014 New Zealand once again began negotiations to have the panels returned . Representatives from the New Zealand Government and Te Papa (the national museum) travelled to Geneva to meet with the Ortiz children who stated that their late father had a desire for the panels to be returned to their country of origin . It has been reported that the New Zealand government paid $4.5 million NZD to the Ortiz family for the panels’ return as well as some legal fees . In early July 2014, the panels were returned to New Zealand and to temporary storage at Te Papa . According to Christopher Finlayson, the National Party Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations Minister, the returned panels are ‘intended to be used for cultural redress as part of the Treaty settlement process‘, in other words they will be returned to the Te Āti Awa iwi for likely preservation at Puke Ariki . In March 2015, the panels were returned to the Te Āti Awa iwi in Taranaki and will be conserved and on display in the Puke Ariki Museum, New Plymouth ."
"77.txt","Organized theft of over 250 archaeologically-excavated artefacts from a repository in Alabama. The site of Moundville near Tuscaloosa, Alabama (USA), was the ceremonial centre of a Mississippian polity from the eleventh to the sixteenth century AD. It is a National Historic Landmark, it is on the National Register of Historic Places, and it consists of twenty-nine platform mounds and a rectangular plaza. The protected area also contains a museum, an archaeological laboratory, and an associated archaeological repository. In 1980 thieves broke into the Erskine Ramsey Archaeological Repository on the Moundville site. They stole 264 pottery vessels, including ‘many of the highest-quality specimens ever excavated at Moundville’, which had been archaeologically excavated in the 1930s . Moundville Archaeological Site, source , 1980 when students from the University of Michigan discovered boxes full of antiquities lined up against the repository wall as if waiting to be carried away. This has led some to speculate that the artefacts had been moved in several trips, with at least one more trip planned . The stolen pottery represents one fifth of the entire Moundville vessel collection and seventy per cent of the site’s museum-quality pieces . This clear focus on high quality pieces may indicate that the thieves were familiar enough with Mississippian artefacts to be able to tell the difference . The theft at Moundville remains the largest recorded antiquities theft in the South of the United States . According to Jim Knight, chairman of anthropology at the Tuscaloosa campus of the University of Alabama, the theft at Moundville was not adequately publicised after it occurred . Although a notice was placed in the Journal of Field Archaeology , Knight believes that the general public was not informed of the situation. Cathy Andreen, spokeswoman for the University of Alabama, has confirmed that there is no record that the school made any attempt to raise public awareness of the theft, and a spokesman for the FBI, the lead law enforcement agency on the case in 1980, stated that the bureau could find no mention of the theft in agency records . Moundville Archaeological Site, source unknown. In 2009 Knight believed that the case is not entirely cold and there is a good chance the Moundville material may still be recoverable, especially if it remains in the United States . All of the stolen artefacts had been thoroughly recorded and photographed by Margaret Hardin of the University of Maine and Vincas Steponaitis of the State University of New York prior to the theft . Images of all missing pieces have been made available on a website devoted to their recovery (see: ). 2018 Recovery In 2018 the reward offered for information leading to the recovery of the Moundville artefacts was increased to $20,000 and then to $25,000 , and due to efforts by archaeologists with the University of Alabama, the nearly 40-year-old theft gained considerable media attention. Jim Knight expressed hope that innovations in information sharing via social media would lead to the return of the stolen artefacts, none of which had been recovered up to that point . It appears these efforts have been effective. In August of 2018, three out of the 264 stolen vessels were recovered, and the return was announced by the Moundville Archaeological Park in November of that year. At the time of writing, no details about a possible criminal investigation have been provided, and the $25,000 reward has not been claimed ."
"78.txt","Museum theft at Mexico’s national museum which resulted in the loss of several of the country’s most famous artefacts. These artefacts were later recovered. On Christmas Eve, 24 December 1984, 124 artefacts were stolen from the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. The majority of these objects were the results of modern archaeological excavations within Mexico, and several of them had passed into use as national symbols. The most famous piece taken was the jade mosaic funerary mask of K’inich Janaab’ Pakal who ruled the Classic Maya polity of Palenque for sixty-eight years until his death on 23 August 683 at age 80. The mask was located in Pakal’s intact tomb, which was discovered by archaeologist Alberto Ruz Lhuillier within Palenque’s Temple of the Inscriptions. The tomb was uncovered in 1952 after four years of painstaking excavation and Pakal’s funerary objects quickly become some of the most well known objects of Maya art. Besides Pakal’s funerary mask, a number of other jade and gold objects were also stolen, including gold artefacts recovered from the famous Cenote of Sacrifice, a natural karstic well at the Postclassic Maya site of Chichén Itzá . Nine police guards were on duty during the night of the theft but, perhaps due to the holiday, were not very vigilant. Although the guards were supposed to visit each room of the museum at least once per hour, the thieves were able to open seven glass display cases in three different exhibition halls, and the theft was not discovered until the day shift of guards arrived at eight in the morning . Some reports indicate that the guards were either drunk or sleeping during the theft . At the time, the museum did not have an electric alarm system. While some Mexican authorities speculated that the objects would appear on the international market, most experts viewed the objects as far too famous to be sellable, speculating that the thieves might destroy the artefacts once they found that out . Experts noted that the thieves stole the highest quality, most valuable portable objects in the museum and concluded that they were professionals. In June 1989, 111 of the objects were recovered from a house in the México City suburb of Satelite . Carlos Perches Treviño, age 28, was caught in the home and a warrant was issued for the arrest of Ramón Sardina García, age 30. According to Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo , Perches stated that the two men, both veterinary school dropouts, had planned the heist for six months. They made more than fifty trips to the museum, taking photographs, examining the display cases, and watching the security guards. They crawled through an air conditioning duct into the basement of the museum’s Maya Room and spent thirty minutes removing pieces from their cases and placing them in a canvas suitcase. They left the museum through the same duct and never saw a security guard. The men had no clear plan of what to do with the artefacts and the suitcase was hidden on top of Perches’ closet for a year until he moved to Acapulco. There he made contacts with drug traffickers to whom he tried to sell the artefacts in return for cocaine. When the deal never came through, Perches returned to Mexico City with the objects. It was one of the traffickers, Salvador ‘el Cabo’ Gutierrez, who turned Perches in to the authorities following his own arrest . Perches was charged with theft of a national treasure and he was also said to face cocaine trafficking charges. The stolen artefacts were reported to be in good condition, although a mask portraying the Zapotec bat god Murcielago from the site of Monte Albán required repair."

The Christie’s website entry for the earrings advised that they had been acquired by the previous owner prior to 1989. However, working in collaboration with Iraqi experts, the FBI had established that the earrings were part of the ‘Nimrud’ treasure, a collection of Neo-Assyrian gold and jewellery discovered in 1989 during the official excavation of two royal tombs underneath the palace of Ashurnasirpal II.

"8.txt","The so-called Benghazi Treasure is a group of antiquities that was excavated in Cyrenaica after the First World War during the Italian occupation of Libya . It consists of three collections of archaeologically excavated material: 1. Objects excavated from the Temple of Artemis in Cyrene in 1917, including a number of gold items, which date to the fifth and sixth centuries BC. 2. Objects excavated from the Palace of Columns in Ptolemais in 1937 which date to the Hellenistic period. 3. The Meliu collection of 2,000 coins. All told, the treasure is thought to comprise ‘364 gold coins, 2,433 silver coins, 4,484 bronze coins, 306 pieces of jewelry and 43 other antiquities’ . Removal to Italy, Return to Libya In 1942, Italian archaeologists sent the treasure to Rome packed within military chests as allied forces advanced on Libya and in 1944 the chests were moved first to Cremona and then to Val Brenta . After the war, the chests were moved back to Rome and were deposited in the Museo Coloniale . In 1961 the treasure, still in the two military chests, was returned to Libya and an inventory compiled, however photographs were not taken . The chests were moved to two safes within a bank vault in the National Commercial Bank on Omar al-Mukhtar Street, Benghazi, where they remained untouched for several decades . In 1980, more archaeological material was added to the chests and again they were sealed in the vault . Theft of the Treasure Approximately three months after rebel took the city of Benghazi during the protracted overthrow of the government of Muammar Gaddafi , much of the Benghazi Treasure was stolen . According to Osama El-Ketaf, the head of the National Commercial Bank’s legal office, on 25 May 2011 looters drilled through more than two feet of steel-reinforced concrete directly into the vault that contained the treasure, making a hole that was just large enough for a very skinny adult to fit through . ‘They sawed through the hinges of one [safe], maybe using a circular saw. We found an extension cord leading from the building next door to the hole. They cut through the back of the other safe’ . Safe that was broken into in the vault, photo from BBC 2011 Mohammed El-Shelmany of the Benghazi office of the Department of Antiquities said that the thieves had left behind about ten percent of the objects originally housed in the vault, taking only the most valuable artefacts . During his investigation into the robbery, El-Shelmany located among the remaining antiquities eight sealed boxes containing modern keys. Bank officials stated that these were spares to other banks in the neighborhood that had been stored with the antiquities for safekeeping . El-Shelmany wonders why the looters did not bother opening the sealed boxes. Bank officials did not report the theft until October 2011, over six months later. Some reporters speculated that this was out of fear that Benghazi’s international reputation would suffer as the city fought for international recognition during the overthrow of Gaddafi . Others have implied that there was a more sinister motive for the bank’s failure to inform authorities . An Inside Job? Hafed Walda, a Libyan archaeologist, was quoted as saying ‘I have the feeling this must have been an inside job. The treasure was there for many years, not many people knew about it, and the robbers even ignored cash that was in the vault’ . Ahmed Buzaian, a professor of archaeology at Benghazi University stated ‘I cannot say who did it, but they knew exactly what was inside’ . In response to allegations that bank employees might have been responsible for the theft, El-Ketaf replied ‘it might have been someone at the Department of Antiquities. They all know what was there’ . Potential for Recovery According to UNESCO’s Assistant Director-General for Culture Francesco Bandarin, the main fear is that the metal objects have been melted down and sold . Some early reports indicated that 500 coins from the Benghazi Treasure turned up in Egypt and that others have appeared on the black market in Libya . Various commentators described the Libya/Egypt border as ‘porous’ at the time of the theft and speculated that this was the route the looted material would take out of Libya . Nick Meo of The Telegraph reported that an Egyptian farmer was caught with over 500 coins and a gold figurine that may to have come from the Benghazi Treasure theft ."
"80.txt","Terracotta figurative sculpture found on the Bauchi plateau of Nigeria. Heavily looted from the 1970s onwards. The people of the Nok culture occupied the Bauchi plateau of central Nigeria from approximately 1000 BC to 500 AD. They were innovative iron smelters, but the Nok culture is best known today for its Nok and associated Katsina and Sokoto terracotta figures. They portray both animals and humans in various postures. The human figures often have elaborate hair, modeled jewellery, and sometimes portray physical ailments. Because the vast majority of Nok terracottas have been looted from their archaeological contexts, their function in Nok society is unknown. The first known Nok terracottas were found in 1928 in a tin mine near the village of Nok. It is from this village that the culture’s modern name is derived. The objects were placed in a museum in Jos, which at the time was located in the headquarters of the Department of Mines . In 1943, more figures were found during tin mining operations near Nok, with one piece, the famous Jemaa Head, being used as the head of a scarecrow. The director of the mine bought this piece and brought it to British archaeologist Bernard Fagg in Jos . Fagg asked the tin miners to be on the lookout for more terracotta pieces which he suspected were being found but discarded. In 1952 a national museum was opened in Jos to house the Nok terracottas that had been collected . Systematic archaeological excavations of the Nok cultural site of Taruga in the 1960s provided radiocarbon dates for the culture. Some theft and illegal export of Nok terracottas was reported in the 1960s , and in the 1970s there was a surge in both illegally exported and fake Nok terracottas on the international art market . The increasing number of fakes on the market established the importance of thermoluminescence (TL) dating for authenticity testing. One company that has been providing TL dates since the late 1970s is the Bortolot Daybreak Corporation of Guilford, Connecticut, USA. In August 2012 this company claimed via its website that before 1993, most Nok terracottas appearing on the market were fakes, and that genuine objects were usually poorly-preserved fragments. According to Bortolot, however, in 1993 a consortium of European dealers organized systematic looting of the Nok area, whereupon there was a flood of genuine heads, and fakes all but disappeared (Bortolot ). A report prepared by archaeologist Patrick Darling in 1995 at the request of the World Heritage Committee corroborates the Bortolot story and fleshes out some of the details . Darling discovered that large scale looting had commenced in the Nok area in mid-1994. By 1995, two main local traders had emerged, each able to employ about 1,000 diggers . At the height of the looting, an estimated ten terracottas a day were being uncovered, and although the majority of them were broken pieces, some were largely intact and eminently saleable . Prices might have dropped accordingly , though a different account of the digging at that time suggests that competition amongst dealers on the ground actually forced prices up . Routes out of Nigeria passed through Lomo in Togo and Cotonou in Benin, and on to Brussels and Paris and other European destinations . Darling also drew attention to the prevalence of fakes and the response of TL dating . The Bortolot website reported the 2002 arrest of dealer Mourtala Diop in New York on charges of fraudulently misrepresenting and selling fake Nok terracottas as genuine using altered Bortolot Daybreak TL certificates as proof of authenticity . In fact, by the early 2000s, Nok terracottas of uncertain authenticity had become plentiful in the United States, available from Nigerian traders in the Chelsea area of Manhattan, uptown galleries , and the Internet , suggesting that by then trafficking routes had extended from Europe across the Atlantic. New York seizure, 2012 (Photo: ICE) In 1979, Nigeria’s National Commission of Museums and Monuments Decree no 77 established the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM) to manage Nigeria’s cultural heritage, and made it illegal for anybody other than an authorized person to buy or sell antiquities within Nigeria or to export an antiquity without a permit from the NCMM. An antiquity was defined as, among other things, an object of archaeological interest, or a work of art made before 1918 of historical, scientific or artistic interest and currently or previously used in ceremonial or traditional context . The NCMM has been criticized for not publishing a list of export permissions , and the requirement to obtain a permit for export seems to be easily evaded. In 2001, for example, a Nigerian dealer based in Lagos claimed that he was able to obtain export documentation from the NCMM by presenting material as contemporary arts and crafts for exhibition abroad, and that such documentation was sufficient to pass Nigerian customs . In 2008, French customs officials seized crates inbound from Togo and marked ‘craftwork’ which upon inspection were revealed to contain Nigerian artefacts, one of which was ascertained by TL dating to be an authentic Nok figure (ICOM nd). In 2010, US Homeland Security at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York seized ten Nok terracottas . The pieces had been recognized in transit at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris and French agents had alerted the United States Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The terracottas were listed as handicrafts and personal effects on their customs forms . On 26 July 2012, the pieces were formally returned to Nigeria. Nigeria’s Consul General Habib Baba Habu claimed that they had been stolen from the Nigerian National Museum in Lagos and that the museum’s director-general was under investigation . ICOM Red List In 2000, ‘Nok terracotta from the Bauchi Plateau and the Katsina and Sokoto regions’ was included on the International Council of Museums’ (ICOM) Red List of categories of African archaeological objects particularly at risk from looting . The Red List noted that all objects on the list were ‘protected by national legislation, banned from export, and may under no circumstances be put on sale’, and appealed to ‘museums, auction houses, art dealers and collectors to stop buying them’ . It revealed that the corpus of officially excavated and provenienced Nok figures in Nigerian museums was not representative of the material appearing on the art market, and that Nigerian museums did not own any complete figures, though again, complete figures were plentiful on the market. The same year, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts announced its acquisition of a Sokoto head and torso , stating that ‘The recent discoveries in Sokoto are opening a new chapter in African art history that demonstrates that cultural and artistic development was earlier and more widespread in this region than previously thought’ . No account of provenance was provided. More museum acquisitions were to follow. In 1995, Jacques Chirac was elected president of France and he quickly moved to implement his intention of gathering cultural objects from Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas—tagged as ‘arts premiers’—into France’s archetypal art museum the Louvre. By 1996, a government-appointed committee had recommended that the plan would be better served by a new, purpose-built museum, consolidating collections from the Musée de l’Homme and the Musée National des Arts d’Afrique et d’Océanie (MNAAO), augmented by newly-acquired material . This museum subsequently opened as the Musée du quai Branly in 2006, with a collection of something like 300,000 objects . As a foretaste of what was to come, a selection of objects was placed on display in the Louvre’s Pavillon des Sessions in April 2000. The exhibition included two Nok terracottas, seemingly acquired in contravention of Nigerian law and the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property , and in disregard of the ICOM Red List . The terracottas had been bought from the Brussels dealer Samir Borro in 1998 for 2.5 million francs, and the purchase had been retrospectively authorized by the Nigerian Minister of Culture in February 2000 after Chirac had personally intervened with the president of Nigeria . However, the Nigerian embassy in Paris maintained that the authorization was invalid because it had not been approved by the NCMM, and the terracottas had not been licensed for export . In March 2002, a settlement was reached whereby Nigeria agreed to loan the pieces to France for a renewable period of twenty-five years , and it has been reported that in 2005 this period was extended to thirty-seven years . This apparent post hoc legitimation of illicit trade was welcomed by some commentators , but condemned by others , with the Nigerian lawyer Folarin Shyllon denouncing it as ‘an unrighteous conclusion’ and a ‘smuggler’s charter’ . In July 2012, a search of the Musée du quai Branly’s on-line collections database found eight Nok terracottas, none with a provenance extending back to before Nigeria’s 1979 National Commission of Museums and Monuments Decree: Terracotta head with three faces ; from MNAAO, gift of Roger Azar. Multiple-headed terracotta relief ; from Samir Borro. Fragment of a terracotta head ; from MNAAO. Whole terracotta figure ; from Samir Borro. Terracotta head ; from MNAAO. Terracotta zoomorphic figure ; from MNAAO, bought at Hôtel Drouot. Fragment of a terracotta head ; from MNAAO, from Barbier-Mueller collection. Terracotta head ; from MNAAO, from Pierre Harter collection."
"81.txt","A spectacular collection of Classic Maya pottery thought to have been systematically looted from Guatemalan sites throughout the 1980s now in the possession of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. In 2010 the Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), Boston, unveiled its ‘Art of the Americas Wing’: a multi-story, multi-gallery, multi-million dollar extension focused on the artistic output of North, Central, and South America from ancient times up to the present. A prominent feature of the lowest story of the wing is an impressive group of Classic Maya polychrome pottery known as the November Collection. The collection comprises 138 pieces of jade, pottery, incense burners, effigy figures, and other objects (IFAR ; Museum of Fine Arts Boston ) and contains some of the finest examples of Maya artistic prowess. The MFA Collections website records the November Collection’s provenance as: Collected between 1974 and 1981 by John Fulling, Art Collectors of November, Inc., Florida (and known as the “November Collection”); to Landon T. Clay, Boston, Massachusetts, in 1987; to MFA, December 1988, gift of Landon T. Clay. These pieces are thought to have been illegally looted from the Petén region of Guatemala in the 1970s or early 1980s and brought into the United States without export permits . The November Collection was initially amassed by a Florida-based collector named John B. Fulling. According to his obituary on the website of the John B. Fulling Haitian Art Collection: In the 1960’s John developed an interest in Mayan art, so just like Indiana Jones, off he went into the jungles of Guatemala, with guides and guns, to accumulate one of the largest collections of Mayan art in North America. . Before he died in 2005, Fulling stated that he bought the objects through Guatemalan dealers in the 1970s and had no idea how recently they were excavated [1]. Public records show that Fulling created ‘Art Collectors of November, Inc’, registered on 7 April 1981 as a domestic for-profit corporation in Ft Lauderdale , listing himself as the president, Robin S. Fulling as the vice president, and Martin F. Avery Jr. as the corporation’s agent. It is not known when, where and how the material that came to form the collection entered the United States. In 1987, Landon T. Clay, former chair of the Eaton Vance Corporation and founder of the Clay Mathematics Institute in Cambridge Massachusetts , bought the November Collection from Fulling (IFAR). Clay, who was a trustee of the MFA at the time and who remains an honorary trustee as of 2 April 2012, donated the November Collection to the MFA in 1988. Some reports indicate that Clay stored the collection at the museum before formally donating it . Although it is unclear exactly when the November Collection was imported into the USA, at least one piece of the collection had been in the country since 1975, two since 1978, and eighteen more since 1981. The first time that a November Collection piece appears to have been published was in a 1975 volume by Francis Robicsek . The photograph shows only a portion of the pot which is listed as ‘Photograph courtesy Nicholas Hellmuth/C-78′[2]. The first reference to the November Collection by name appears in a 1978 volume also by Robicsek who reproduced four views of a pot that is now in the MFA (accession number 1988.1171; ). Also in 1978 a November Collection vase was published by Michael Coe who lists the piece as “Collection: anonymous” . Robicsek is the primary early publisher of November Collection pieces and with the exception of the one publication by Coe[3], no other November Collection object appears in print until Robicsek’s own 1981 and 1982, volumes which appear to have been prepared at the same time in 1981. The 1982 volume specifically focuses on the corpus, referring to it as the November Collection, and depicts 22 pieces of pottery that are now in the MFA . Neither the Robicsek volumes nor Coe’s book mention any ownership information beyond ‘November Collection’. By the time that Clay purchased the pieces, the November Collection had developed a bad reputation among Mayanists. Indeed, upon hearing that the MFA had acquired the November Collection, Boston University archaeologist Clemency C. Coggins formally contacted Alan Shestack warning him that the collection was both illicit and illegal and urging him to decline the donation . In a letter to Coggins, Shestack stated that the collection was not “exported from its country of origin or anyplace else in violation of that country’s laws” . Shestack’s successor, Malcolm Rogers , has said that because of the MFA’s ‘lavish due diligence’ (quoted in ), he is convinced that the museum acquired the November Collection legally. Yet Weld S. Henshaw, the attorney who conducted the 1987 legal inquiry into the November Collection for the MFA, was quoted in the Boston Globe as saying that both he and the MFA were aware that there were legality issues with the objects . Henshaw stated that at the time he was researching the November Collection he was unaware of a 1947 Guatemalan law barring the export of antiquities without permits (see footnote) but knew about a 1987 law that required essentially the same thing. He told the Boston Globe that the November Collection was exported from Guatemala without permits (an assertion that was confirmed by Fulling according to Yemma and Robinson and that, due to civil war and local instability, Guatemalan officials were not even aware that the collection was in the United States. He advised the MFA that since Guatemala had not yet formally objected to the items being in the US, the donation was acceptable (IFAR ). An official request for the return of the November Collection to Guatemala made in the late 1980s was impeded by the unrest in the country. In 1989, then Guatemalan Cultural Affairs Officer Martina Regina de Fahsen wrote a letter to the MFA inquiring about the legality of the November Collection. De Fahsen told the Boston Globe that her request was rebuffed by Shestack and that she forwarded the correspondence on to the Guatemalan Foreign Ministry, but that domestic instability prevented immediate follow up . The Guatemalan Government has since requested documentation from the Museum of Fine Arts that would prove that the objects were exported legally. A 1998 response to this request by Rogers states that the MFA board of trustees ‘found no basis’ for Guatemala’s claim of ownership of the November collection because the country could not produce legal title to the pieces . Guatemalan officials have alleged that MFA representatives asked them how much their country would pay to have the collection returned . Archaeologists are unsure of where exactly these objects came from within Guatemala. Most believe they are the result of the looting of numerous sites rather than just one. Some November collection pieces bear emblem glyphs from the sites of Naranjo (Guatemala), San Agustin Acasaguastlán (Guatemala) (see Kerr’s ), others are inscribed with the names of Tintal and Nakbe in the Mirador Basin . However, these sorts of pots may have been widely traded or may have served as political gifts between polities and thus could have been looted from anywhere in the region. It is unlikely that they will be matched definitively to the archaeological sites that they came from."
"82.txt","Nazca and Paracas cemeteries that were looted throughout the 20th century for sellable ancient textiles; aslo the site of a famous class of fake antiquity, the so-called Ica Stones. The Ocucaje district, one of the 14 districts Peru’s the Ica Province, is a wine-producing area that sits on the edge of an arid region known as the Ocucaje desert. Its name is derived from the Hacienda Ocucaje, now located on the Panamerican Highway about 35 km south of Ica and 130 km northwest of Nazca. The Nazca and Paracas Cultures, among others, inhabited the Ocucaje region and the arid climate has led to the preservation of such rare cultural materials as textile, feather work, and wood implements. The sites in the region have been heavily looted. From the early 2oth century onwards, the owners of the Hacienda Ocucaje are known to have collected pre-Conquest cultural material and are thought to have participated in the looting of nearby sites . The majority of looted Ocucaje material comes from several known pre-Conquest cemeteries at sites such as Cerro Max Uhle and Cerro de la Cruz. Tombs at these sites are typically rectangular with adobe brick walls and form two superimposed chambers separated by logs or canes . The tombs tend to be individual burials. These burials are primarily associated with Nazca and Paracas cultures. In January and February of 1901, archaeologist Max Uhle excavated several cemeteries near the Hacienda Ocucaje. At the time, the hacienda was managed by a Dr. Ernesto Mazzei with whom Uhle was obliged to share the contents of some of the graves that he located . Uhle also purchased Nazca cultural material from a local dealer which indicates that sites in the area were being looted at that time . The Soldi Collection Looting Photo taken by Soldi and given to Dawson for The Junius B. Bird Pre-Columbian Textile Conference, May 19th and 20th, 1973 In 1941 an Ica-based dealer in antiquities named Pablo Soldi allegedly began a large-scale operation to commercially loot archaeological sites in the Ica Valley . This venture lasted approximately 18 years and during this time the Ocucaje cemetery sites identified by Uhle as well as others were hit. Soldi sold a number of mummy masks from Ocucaje to Paul Truel, then a co-owner of the Hacienda Ocucaje. Subsequent Ocucaje material passed through Soldi’s hands and ended up for sale on the United States art market . In 1960 archaeologist By 1965 a portion of Soldi’s collection had found its way to the National Textile Museum and another portion was sold to the American Museum of Natural History . According to the records available on the American Museum of Natural History website, the museum purchased over 100 objects from Soldi in 1959, most of which are listed as having come from Ocucaje sites such as Cerro Max Uhle (American Museum of Natural History ). Ocucaje Material on the Market Looting damage which occurred 2010 at Ocucaje from Noticias de Nasca Examples of Ocucaje textiles have appeared on the art market for the past few decades. For unknown reasons, they are some of the only South American objects that have site name provenience listed in high-end auction catalogues. For example, on 24 November 1986 , two textiles offered from the estate of actor Zero Mostel were listed as coming from Cerro Max Uhle . Only one of the fifty nine other South American antiquities lots offered at that sale contained provenience data as specific as a site name, a gilt copper headband listed as being from the heavily looted site of Loma Negra. It is impossible to tell if Mostel’s textiles truly came from Cerro Max Uhle, but the inclusion of the site name suggests a certain degree of comfort with the looting incident that produced the pieces. Recent reports indicate that looting continues at Ocucaje. The area is said to be poorly policed and signage instructing members of the public to stay off the site is barely visible . Locals report that looting operations at Ocucaje sites start at around 11 pm (because by then dogs have stopped barking) and digging continues until around 3 am . Fakes and Dinosaurs: The Ica Stones Dr Javier Cabrera with his collection of Ica Stones, source unknown Ocucaje is also the place of origin for a massive amount of popular hoax artefacts known as the ‘Ica stones’. These engraved andesitic stones show images such as humans hunting dinosaurs and are said to date to the pre-Conquest. Javier Cabrera Darquea, a Peruvian physician who collected and popularized the Ica stones, purchased 341 of them from Pablo Soldi and his brother Carlos with the understanding that they came from their excavations of pre-Conquest graves . The Soldi brothers are said to have told Cabrera that they could not get archaeologists interested in the pieces. Cabrera abandoned his medical practice, converted the lower floor of his home into a museum, and devoted the rest of his life to these stones . He reportedly collected around 11,000 of them and around 50,000 are thought to be circulating around the world . In 1975 two farmers, Basilio Uschuya and Irma Gutiérrez de Aparcana, informed noted pseudoscientist Erich von Daniken that they had forged the stones based off of images of dinosaurs from comic books. They later claimed they only said that the stones were forged to avoid being arrested for antiquities trafficking. In 1977 Uschuya crafted an Ica stone on film for a BBC documentary entitled ‘Pathways to the Gods’ . That same year Uschuya was arrested for selling archaeological material by Peruvian authorities. He signed a legal confession admitting that the Ica stones were a hoax and was released . Real Fossils at Ocucaje Finally, the Ocucaje desert is host to a significant amount of illicit excavations for fossils . Fossils, like antiquities, are classified as national patrimony under Peruvian law and, thus, are not exportable. However recent reports indicate that the region is not effectively policed and fossil digging goes largely unpunished ."

Between 1991 and 1997, he acted as agent for the Miho Museum, which opened in 1997. He is thought to have obtained many objects from the Italian antiquities dealer Gianfranco Becchina .

Operation Geryon was the name given by Italian Carabinieri to an investigation into the armed theft in January 1994 of eight Greek decorated vases from the medieval castle of Melfi, which had been an Italian state museum since 1950 . The vases were recovered in October 1994 during a police search of the antiquities dealer Antonio ‘Nino’ Savoca’s home in Munich, Germany. The Munich search was conducted at the request of Greek police who believed Savoca to be implicated in the theft and smuggling of Greek artefacts. The Carabinieri were invited to participate in the raid because Savoca was an Italian citizen. Along with the Melfi pots, the search revealed boxes full of broken artefacts from Italy, Greece, and Bulgaria, and a large cleaning facility containing intact pottery. The police also seized a card index cataloguing Savoca’s business transactions, which contained the name of Luigi Coppola as supplier of the Melfi vases. Back in Italy, the Carabinieri placed Coppola and his colleague Pasquale Camera, who had previously been a captain in the Guardia di Finanza, under surveillance. In August 1995, Camera was killed in a car crash while on his way to visit antiquities dealer Frieda Tchacos . Photographs of what appeared to be illegally-excavated antiquities recovered from the wreckage of his car provided the Carabinieri with cause to search Camera’s Rome apartment. There they discovered real and fake artefacts, hundreds of photographs of artefacts, and paper documentation of Camera’s dealings. The names found in the documents led to seventy further raids and the arrest of nineteen people, who were subsequently tried and convicted . One of the raids was of the apartment of Danilo Zicchi in September 1995, which recovered sixty artefacts . Zicchi admitted that his apartment had been used to store illegally-excavated artefacts, and that acting on instruction he would mail artefacts abroad. The artefacts were usually broken into fragments for postage, to make for a smaller package, but also to attract less attention if the parcel should accidentally break. During a second visit to Zicchi’s apartment, the Carabinieri discovered Camera’s handwritten ‘organigram’ of the Italian antiquities trade, which triggered investigations of Giacomo Medici, Robert Hecht and Gianfranco Becchina. Operation Geryon was closed in autumn 1995."

The ‘organigram’ is a handwritten organizational chart that was recovered in September 1995 during a Carabinieri raid on the premises of Danilo Ziccho . Drawn by dealer Pasquale Camera, it presents a view of the antiquities trade within Italy as envisaged by Camera in the early 1990s. The US dealer Robert Hecht occupies a central place on the chart, with links to collectors and museums in the USA, to major antiquities dealers Nikos Koutoulakis, Eli Borowsky and Frieda Tchacos, and to the collector George Ortiz (who is in fact Bolivian, not Argentinian as suggested on the chart). Hecht is also shown to stand at the head of two chains of dealers and tombaroli within Italy, one orchestrated by Gianfranco Becchina, the other by Giacomo Medici. The assumption when the organigram was first discovered, which was later substantiated by investigations of Becchina and Medici, was that these chains were responsible for supplying Hecht with artifacts illegally excavated from within Italy that he would then sell on to museums and collectors in the USA . A notable feature of the organization presented on the chart is that the Becchina and Medici chains are largely independent of one another. Members of each separate chain referred to themselves as being part of a cordata, the Italian term for a group of mountaineers roped together .

A finger was stolen in 1958 and smuggled by actor James Stewart and the complete hand was stolen in the early 1990s. The Nepali village of Pangboche is quite close to the base of Mount Everest and is a stopping point on the most heavily used route for climbers and trekkers on their way to Everest Base Camp . It is considered to be a holy place. According to legend, Lama Sangwa Dorjee, who brought Buddhism to the region in the 17th century, flew over the Himalayas and landed on a rock at Pangboche, leaving his footprints in the stone and founding several monasteries. The monastery at Pangboche is the oldest monastery attributed to either Lama Sangwa Dorjee or one of his incarnations. The Pangboche Monastery is famous for being the home of a fragmentary mummified hand that is said to have come from a Yeti. Yeti are well-known characters in high-Himalaya popular mythology and have been incorporated into the local interpretation of Buddhism. Yeti are also a common topic of conversation between western climbers and the Indigenous people of the region. Most climbers report hearing stories of Yeti , and some report seeing evidence of Yeti with their own eyes or participate in searches for evidence of the Yeti . At least historically, the Yeti was perceived as a threat to the people of the region, and a widespread fear of Yeti has been recorded among the Sherpa . The Pangboche hand was treated as a ritual object that was connected to the luck and safety of the monastery. Other monasteries in the region also have yeti relics which served similar purposes, for example a yeti skullcap housed at the Khumjung monestary . In 1958 an explorer named Peter Byrne traveled to the Himalayas to look for evidence of the existence of the Yeti . While staying at Pangboche, Byrne reported that a Nepalese-speaking monastery custodian showed him what looked like a large mummified primate hand . Back in London, Byrne related the story of the hand to Professor William Osman Hill, a primatologist at the Royal College of Surgeon’s Hunterian Museum, and to Tom Slick, a Texas oil heir and the funder of the Yeti expedition. Pangboche finger. Image from Daily Mail. Both Hill and Slick were interested in obtaining the hand, however Byrne made it clear that the lamas at Pangboche believed that the removal of the hand would bring disaster to the temple . In the most lurid version of the story, which seems to have been told in several different ways, the three men are then alleged to have hatched a plan to steal one of the fingers for scientific testing. Prof. Hill is said to have produced a brown paper bag that contained a desiccated human finger for Byrne to take back to Nepal . Once there, this account has Byrne stealing one of the fingers from the Yeti hand, and replacing it with the finger provided by Prof. Hill . Writing in 2011, Byrne presents a slightly different account of how he came into possession of the finger than has been previously published in the media. He claims that, upon receiving a wire from Hill and Slick instructing him to obtain the hand while he was still in Nepal, he began to bargain with the lamas . He states that they agreed to give him a finger if he replaced it with another finger and made a contribution to the temple. Byrne then hiked back to India, flew to London, obtained the finger from Hill, and returned with it to Nepal . There he wired it into place with the permission of the monks. Other accounts state that he got the monks drunk so that they would not protest . Byrne states that he planned to hold on to the finger for a few months and then find someone in Kathmandu who could smuggle the object either into the US or the UK . However he claims that he received a cable from Slick instructing him to make his way to Calcutta where he would meet with American actor James Stewart and his wife Gloria at the Grand Hotel . Working on the premise that a famous movie star would face less scrutiny at customs, Byrne has said that Gloria Stewart hid the Yeti finger in her lingerie case and the couple smuggled the finger into the UK at Heathrow Airport . In the 1960s the smuggled portion of the Pangboche hand drifted into obscurity. However, in 1991 it was discovered that an American anthropologist named George Agogino possessed a portion of the finger. This sample was tested for the popular television program Unsolved Mysteries. Shortly after the airing of the Unsolved Mysteriesepisode devoted to the Pangboche hand, the composite object was stolen from the Pangboche Monastery . The whereabouts of the hand is unknown. Pangboche hand photographed by Byrne in 1958. Rediscovery of Hand Fragments and Testing In 1975 the poorly catalogued specimen collection of Dr. Hill was bequeathed to the Royal College of Surgeons’ Hunterian museum . In 2008, a box in this collection was found to contain a 9 cm long finger fragment labeled as having come from a Yeti hand in the Pangboche monastery . In 2011 the finger remains were subjected to DNA testing by Dr. Rob Ogden, the genetic expert at Edinburgh Zoo. The bones were determined to be human . Dr. Rob Jones of the Zoological Society of Scotland stated that the DNA sequence from the finger was a ‘very strong match to a number of existing human sequences from China and that region of Asia’ . This sample remains in the possession of the Royal College of Surgeons’ Hunterian Museum in London . Mike Allsop (see below) has stated that the monastery would like to have the finger returned . Another Replacement and Calls for Return In 2010, climber Mike Allsop approached New Zealand’s Weta Workshop, famous for their production of props and effects for such films as the Lord of the Rings and Avatar, about the possibility of recreating the stolen hand for the Pangboche Monastery . Working off early photographs of the hand, Weta recreated the object free of charge on the understanding that it would be donated to the monastery. Allsop hopes that the presence of even a fake Yeti hand will attract tourists to the monastery and thus bring the monks there a much-needed income . Allsop maintains a website called Return the Hand which seeks to raise awareness about the theft of the Pangboche hand. He hopes that, through the website, he can ‘reach out to anyone who may have the original artifacts or has knowledge of their whereabouts’ . He asks that ‘if they could find it in their hearts to return these original artifacts, the small village of Pangboche would be forever grateful. Lama Gershe had a stroke in September 2010 and is slowly recovering in Kathmandu. I know he would be very happy if they were returned to their rightful home’ . Allsop offers to pick up and collect the hand anywhere in the world and return it to Pangboche, ‘no questions asked’."
"87.txt","Stolen from Peru’s national museum, the textile was purchased by Australia’s national museum and was returned in 1989 after several years of Peruvian demands. Sometime around 1973 a 2000-year-old textile was stolen from Peru’s National Museum in Lima. The piece, a mantle measuring 3.5 meters by 1.5 meters, was one of three that were taken . The mantle had been excavated by acclaimed Peruvian archaeologist Julio Tello in 1927 at the archaeological site of Cerro Colorado. It was found on “mummy 319”, one of over 400 Paracas culture mummy bundles recovered by Tello and his team during their years of digging at the site . Details about this textile, designated WK 319-10 are available via the Paracas Archaeology Research Resource (Peters ). The Australian National Gallery (now the National Gallery of Australia or NGA) purchased the mantle in 1974 in London from a US-based dealer , paying a reported $35,000 AUD for the piece on behalf of the Australian Government . Professor Jane Dwyer of Brown University, an expert in Peruvian textiles, noticed the NGA’s purchase. She identified the NGA mantle as one that she had recorded and photographed in detail in Peru’s National Museum in the late 1960s . She notified Peru of the purchase and the Peruvian Government, having confirmed that the mantle was one of those stolen from their museum, asked for the its return in 1982 . The NGA and the Australian Government reportedly “refused to accept the mantle was stolen”, denying Peru’s claims and initiating seven years of continued repatriation demands from Peru. In response to 1988 media reports that Peru had, again, demanded the mantle’s return, the NGA issued a statement denying Peru’s claim. Saying that they were “anxious to put this matter to rest”, the NGA stated that they had examined photographic negatives of the stolen textile (presumably supplied by Dwyer) and that although “there were similarities in the overall design”, there were differences between the piece photographed and the piece they held . They also said that Peru’s Ambassador to Australia had issued them a letter on 4 August 1982, confirming that the NGA mantle was not one of the textiles stolen from the Lima museum. Shortly after the NGA’s statement, the museum was presented with what they described as undeniable evidence that the mantle was the property of Peru and had been stolen from that country’s National Museum. Despite this evidence, it was not immediately clear if the museum would be forced by law to return the mantle. In 1986 Australia passed the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act which controls the export and import of cultural heritage items . Section 14.1 of the Act states that when a protected object was unlawfully exported from a foreign country, the piece is liable to forfeiture. However, as the mantle entered Australia before this law took effect, the museum as a good faith purchaser could have argued that the textile’s import into Australia was not prohibited at the time. This argument, however, was not tested at the NGA and the Australian Government agreed to return the stolen mantle to Peru in October 1989. Australian Arts Minister at the time, Clyde Holding, stated that even though they may not have been compelled by law to return the textile, be believed that “it is important to abide by the spirit of the legislation and return this significant piece of Peru’s cultural heritage to the people of Peru” . Peru’s Ambassador to Australia at the time called the return “an act of fair play, typical of the Australian people” . The NGA maintained that they always had good intentions and that their investigations into Peru’s claims for the mantel were “hindered by the fact that both the dealer who sold us the mantle and an American anthropologist who alerted the Peruvian Government to our purchase [Dwyer] had died” . The dealer’s death also prevented the Australian Government from recovering any of the money that they had spent on the textile . The picture accompanying this encyclopedia entry has been provided by Ann H. Peters who runs the spectacular Paracas Archaeological Resource. It shows a detail of the pattern of Wari Kayan 319 specimen 11, which the stolen and returned mantle covered on the original mummy bundle. If you look closely you will see darker coloured patterns, almost shadow-like, on the textile pictured. These are the stains of the pattern of the stolen and returned textile, transferred to this one beneath it, during the approximately 2000 years that the mummy bundle rested in the Paracas necropolis at Wari Kayan. Thus, not only were there photographs and drawings of the stolen and returned mantle in existence when Australia bought the piece, there was another textile still within Peru’s national collection bearing the exact imprint of the one stolen. Thanks to Ann H. Peters for this image and this information."
"88.txt","Masterful funerary textiles looted from Peruvian tombs throughout the 20th century, primarily in the 1930s, becoming a staple of the international antiquities market. The Paracas Culture inhabited the Paracas Peninsula in the Ica Region of Peru from approximately 800 BC to 100 BC. The term ‘Paracas’ is applied broadly: it can refer to two related cultural complexes (Paracas Cavernas and Paracas Necropolis); a textile style (which can also be divided into Cavernas and Necropolis); a ceramic style (the Necropolis version of which is sometimes referred to as Topará); and the region in which these artefacts are found . Due to the arid nature of the region, organic material from Paracas is found to be in a remarkable state of preservation. Human remains from Paracas, commonly referred to as mummy bundles, are bound in a seated position, placed in a flat basket and wrapped in layers of finely woven and embroidered textiles and feathered headdresses . The Paracas Necropolis textiles are considered to be some of the finest textile achievements in the world. The Paracas culture was first identified and described by Peruvian archaeologist Julio Tello who excavated in the Paracas region , however it is clear that looters located many Paracas sites long before Tello appeared on the scene . Tello, himself a critic of the destruction caused by archaeological looting[1], had been monitoring the antiquities market for some time in hopes of discovering the source of a number of elaborate textiles being offered for sale . In 1925 Tello and archaeologist , the archaeologists located the fragmentary remains of textiles which matched the style of those on the market. Tello and fellow archaeologist Toribio Mejía Xesspe returned to Paracas several months later to conduct archaeological excavations which produced over 70 mummy bundles. In 1927, they located what is commonly known as the Paracas Necropolis (also known as the Necrópolis de Wari Kayan) on the north side of Cerro Colorado . Within this context Tello recovered 429 mummy bundles, some of which contained several hundred textiles . Due to their expert craftsmanship and other-worldly iconographic themes, the textiles immediately garnered international attention. On 26 September 1930, Tello was forced to resign the directorship of the Museum of Peruvian Archaeology for political reasons. Without an archaeological presence at the site, the Paracas Necropolis was almost immediately hit by looters. In the leadership vacuum that resulted at Paracas, Tello reports that huaqueros had taken over areas that were still marked with archaeological stakes, particularly in parts of the Wari Kayan area that had not yet been excavated . From 1931 to 1933 the cemeteries were massively looted and, based on the number of human bodies found on the surface by Tello and other archaeologists, the amount of archaeological material removed from the sites must have been great . Paracas Necropolis textiles began to appear on the international market within a year and it is thought that the majority of the Paracas textiles in international collections were smuggled out of Peru at this time . Paracas textiles appear in the collections of most major international museums and have increasingly become the focus of Peruvian repatriation requests. One particular case of note is the Paracas textile collection housed in the Museum of World Culture in Göteborg, Sweden. The collection consists of 100 textile which were “illegally exported” (to use the term on the Museum’s own website) to Sweden between 1931 and 1933 by Sven Karell, the Swedish Consul in Peru . The textiles were featured in an exhibit entitled “A Stolen World: The Paracas Collection” which focused on the textiles’ status as illicit antiquities. The government of Peru requested the return of this collection in December 2009. The city of Göteborg acknowledged the illegal nature of the export of the textiles and in April 2010 they informally agreed to a slow, successive return of the Paracas material . Over a year later no formal decision had been made about the textiles. Some museum administrators believed that the return would never take place due to a Swedish perception that Peru is not financially prepared to care for the fragile pieces . In July 2011, then-president of Peru Alan Garcia announced that legal action would be taken against the city of Göteborg for the return of the textiles, claiming that the city government was ‘complicit in the deprecation and looting of a country and civilization’ . This was seen as a rather surprising move on the part of Garcia given the city’s continued interest in the return of the Paracas material. Critics denounced his threat as being overtly political and related to Garcia’s success with the repatriation of Machu Picchu material from Yale. Four of the textiles are to be returned to Peru on 18 June 2014 with the others expect to follow as their conservation schedule permits. The last is expected to be returned in 2021 ."
"89.txt","The ‘Persian Mummy’ was a recently manufactured mummy recovered by Pakistani police in 2000. It had been made to appear as the dead daughter of the Persian King Xerxes. In March 2000, Amanollah Riggi of New Jersey sent Oscar Muscarella of New York’s Metropolitan Museum four Polaroid photographs of what appeared to be a mummy, together with a translation of a cuneiform inscription that could be seen on the mummy’s gold breastplate. Riggi claimed to be acting on behalf of a Pakistani acquaintance, and said that the mummy was available for purchase. The translation, prepared by a ‘cuneiform expert at a major American university’ , identified the mummy as the daughter of the fifth-century BC Achaemenid Persian King Xerxes. Muscarella soon discovered that he had been supplied with only a part of the expert’s full translation and report, however, which in its entirety judged the inscription to be fake. In any case, Muscarella was skeptical of the mummy’s authenticity because of his own doubts over the iconography of carving visible on its wooden sarcophagus, and did not pursue the matter any further . A few months later, in October 2000, Pakistani police in Karachi arrested one Ali Akbar on suspicion of selling a mummy, along with tribal leader Wali Mohammad Reeki of Quetta, who was in possession of it. This mummy was later found to be the one featured in the photographs seen by Muscarella. Both men were charged with contravening Pakistan’s Antiquity Act. Reeki claimed to have received the mummy from an Iranian named Sharif Shah Bakhi, who has never been located. The mummy was taken to the National Museum in Karachi, where at a preliminary press conference it was announced as the mummified remains of a Persian princess dating to about 600 BC. In the wake of the press conference, a debate broke out between Iran and Pakistan over the rightful ownership of what was seen to be an unparalleled archaeological find. No royal burials had ever been found in the vicinity of Xerxes’ capital Persepolis, and given that Egypt was part of Xerxes’ empire the practice of mummification was not totally out of the question . The mummy itself was subjected to an exhaustive investigation led by Asma Ibrahim of the National Museum of Pakistan . The embalmed body was lying on a reed mat with a stone cover, and had been placed inside a carved wooden sarcophagus. It was decorated with a gold mask and crown, and bore an inscribed gold breastplate declaring ‘I am the daughter of the great King Xerxes … I am Rhodugune’. But as the investigation progressed, doubts about the authenticity of the mummy began to accumulate. Although the sarcophagus was carved with royal symbols, closer examination revealed lead pencil marks that had been made to guide the carving. A CT scan of the body showed that the internal organs, including the heart, lungs and brain, had been removed prior to embalming, which was counter to Egyptian practice. There were grammatical errors on the breastplate’s inscription, and, crucially, the inscriber had used the later Greek version of the princess’s name Rhodugune, instead of the Persian Wardegauna. Finally, radiocarbon dates of the reed mat showed it to be only fifty years old at most. With the mummy’s accoutrements shown to be fake, attention shifted to the body itself, which was that of an adult woman. The CT scan showed that the body had a fractured spine, caused by a blow with a blunt instrument, but an autopsy showed the probable cause of death to have been a broken neck. Radiocarbon dates suggested a date of death around 1996. The autopsy could not show whether the woman’s neck had been broken deliberately or not, but Pakistani police launched a murder investigation. As of 2008, no progress had been made with the case . Meanwhile, it was rumoured that two related mummies were being offered for sale on the international market. On 20 December 2001, the BBC science series Horizon screened a TV documentary on the mummy . The programme drew attention to the resources and organization that must have supported the fabrication of the mummy: a person with knowledge of anatomy and embalming techniques, a cabinet maker, a stone carver, a goldsmith, and someone with a rudimentary knowledge of cuneiform. There would need to have been a facility to conduct mummification, which in itself would have taken half a ton of drying chemicals. The act of mummification must have taken place within 24 hours of the woman’s death. Oscar Muscarella suggested it had most probably taken place in Iran ."

"90.txt","A civil suit filed against collector Benjamin Johnson in a US Court was ruled in favor of the defendant as the government of Peru could not prove that they were the legal owner of the objects in question. In 1987 a large amount of material looted from the Moche site of Sipán, Peru, was trafficked into the USA by a smuggling ring orchestrated by a man named David Swetnam. Swetnam was convicted for his involvement in this operation, but was given what many felt was a light sentence. As it became clear that no further indictments were to be handed down in this case, advocates for the return of Sipán material to Peru filed a civil suit against Benjamin Bishop Johnson a collector, dealer, and authenticator of Pre-Conquest antiquities[1]. Johnson allegedly authenticated the shipment of Sipán material shortly after it entered the United States and purchased at least some of the items . He later sold some of these items to collectors such as John Bourne. The suit against Johnson was organised by a Los Angeles physicist named George Roberts with Noel Keyes, formerly of Pepperdine University, and Meryl Macklin of Heller, Ehrman, White & McAuliffe representing Peru’s interests on a pro bono basis. Macklin eventually resigned from the case citing a difference of opinion with Roberts, leaving Keyes as the sole attorney. Their case hinged on the country of Peru proving that Johnson’s collection was composed of stolen property. This claim was based on Peruvian Law No. 6634 of June 13, 1929 and Peruvian Law No. 24047 of 5 January 1985, which identify the Peruvian State as the rightful owner of undocumented Peruvian antiquities . To fully establish that the Johnson collection was comprised of property stolen from their country, the representatives for Peru had to prove exactly which archaeological site the objects came from. They also had to prove that the objects left Peru after 1929 when the government laid claim to undocumented archaeological material . Peru lost the suit as Keyes was unable to prove to the satisfaction of Judge William P. Gray that the objects in question both came from Peru and were exported after Peru’s ownership laws came into effect . John Merryman, who spoke on Johnson’s behalf during the trial, believes that even if Peru had been able to conclusively prove that the objects in Johnson’s collection came from Sipán and had been exported after 1929, they may not have been able to distinguish ‘theft’ from ‘illegal export’ to the satisfaction of a US Court . While the US would enforce international claims of ownership (theft), they under no obligation to enforce the export laws of Peru at the time (illegal export). Johnson died on 3 September 1990. Much of Johnson’s collection was sold at Sotheby’s New York shortly after his death. For example on 18 November 1991 , seven Peruvian pieces from Johnson’s collection were offered for sale. Shortly after the Johnson case, on 7 May 1990 the US imposed emergency import restrictions on ‘culturally significant archaeological artefacts from the Sipán Region of Peru’ under the Cultural Property Implementation Act and in accordance with the 1970 UNESCO convention . This was expanded into a full, five year cultural property bilateral agreement between the US and Peru in 1997 which barred the import of all pre-Conquest cultural material, not just items from the Sipán region. This agreement was extended for another five years in 2002, 2007, and 2012."
"91.txt","Dealer pleaded guilty to falsely declaring the value of freshly-looted Peruvian antiquities that he attempted to bring into the US In January 1981, David Bernstein, an antiquities dealer based in New York City, was stopped by officials at Dulles International Airport in Washington DC, having returned to the United States from Peru. The dealer, who previously had sold artefacts to such institutions as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago was entering the country with four suitcases. Bernstein informed customs agents that he was carrying 66 Peruvian antiquities worth $1,785 USD, a valuation that they did not believe . Bernstein’s four suitcases were brought to a customs search room; they reportedly were giving off a foul smell. When Bernstein was asked why his luggage smelled bad, agents claim that he said that the things inside had recently been dug up from graves . A search of the suitcases uncovered 158 antiquities including textiles, metal death masks, a feathered poncho, and ceramics . Discussing why he decided to detain and question Bernstein, Customs agent Richard Conger stated that they were paying close attention to flights from Peru at that time and he was aware that antiquities were quite valuable. “I knew the stuff was valuable, I recalled a National Geographic article with a photograph of a preserved pre-Columbian girl-child, and knew that Peruvian textiles could be preserved in graves, and that feathers were even more rare and significant” . As no expert was available to authenticate the pieces, Bernstein was let go but the artefacts were retained under the suspicion that the dealer had falsely declared their value, a violation of US law . On the following Monday, 19 January 1981, Dr Clifford Evans of the Smithsonian and officials from the Peruvian Embassy were able to confirm that the antiquities were authentic and that were worth far more than $1785 USD on the market. A visibly upset Evans estimated that by itself, the feathered poncho was worth over $100,000 USD . Evans suffered a fatal heart attack later that day . Moving forward from this false customs declaration, federal agents obtained a warrant to search Bernstein’s Manhattan residence where they found over 160 more antiquities of dubious origin . These pieces were valued at the time at $1.4 mil USD. On 26 January 1982, Bernstein pleaded guilty to the charge of filing a false customs declaration, a misdemeanour . He further agreed to provide federal investigators with information about both his antiquities buyers and suppliers and to testify in further cases if called upon to do so . He also agreed to return any antiquities that he was unable to prove were purchased outside of Peru. Because of this cooperation, Bernstein was given a one-year suspended sentence, a $1,000 USD fine, and was required to perform 200 hours of community service . Seventy-five of the Peruvian artefacts seized from Bernstein were formally returned in a ceremony at the Peruvian Embassy, Washington DC, in August 1982 . In 1984, the National Geographic Society’s Explorer’s Hall hosted an exhibition titled “Stolen Treasures, Missing Links” which aimed to inform the public about the looting of Peru’s archaeological sites. The exhibition featured a number of the antiquities seized from Bernstein and the suitcase he used to smuggle some of them, reportedly with his name taped over . Bernstein maintained that he legally owned the objects and could have legally sold them, noting his charges only related to the false declaration of the artefacts’ value . He continued to deal in Pre-Columbian antiquities in Manhattan (Bernstein ). He told reporters after his sentencing that he would only deal in antiquities that he purchased in the United States, with a focus on Pre-Columbian textiles . In 1994, several lots of ancient Peruvian jewellery that Bernstein consigned to Sotheby’s auction house were seized by federal agents after they were presented with evidence that the pieces had been looted from Sipán (see Sipán Jewellery Offered for Sale at Sotheby’s)."
"92.txt","During the 1960s a number of archaeologically recorded monuments were looted from the Classic Maya site in Guatemala’s Peten region and trafficked into the United States. Piedras Negras, now located in Guatemala’s Sierra del Lacandón National Park, is the modern name of the Classic Maya polity of Yo’k’ib’ or ‘Great Gateway’. It was an independent city-state for most of the Classic Period and was allied with the polity of Yaxchilán (now in Mexico). It was excavated by a University of Pennsylvania team from 1931 until 1939 and then by Stephen Houston of Brigham Young University and Hector Escobedo from the Universidad de Valle de Guatemala from 1997 until 2002. Various scholars visited the site to record monuments and inscriptions throughout the years, laying the foundation for the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphs. For example, while working with monuments from Piedras Negras, Tatiana Proskouriakoff made the first decipherment of the names and dates of a Maya dynasty, a groundbreaking step which proved that history was recorded in Maya text . Between 1895 and 1899, explorer and early archaeologist Teobert Maler visited Piedras Negras to photograph several of the visible monuments . He removed Piedras Negras Panels 1 and 2 at this time, taking them to Harvard University where they remain . During the 1931 to 1939 excavations, J. Alden Mason, then curator of the American section of the University of Pennsylvania Museum, obtained a permit that allowed for half of the monuments excavated at Piedras Negras to be brought to the United States on loan. The remaining monuments were sent to Guatemala City. The University of Pennsylvania returned most of the Piedras Negras monuments to Guatemala in January 1947, retaining Piedras Negras Stela 14 and a portion of Altar 4 on permanent loan with the permission of the Guatemalan government . Stela 2 from Piedras Negras in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, referred to as ‘mutilated’ by the Institute’s former director In the early 1960s looters, reportedly from the town of Tenosique de Pino Suárez across the Mexican border, descended upon Piedras Negras . Stelae and architectural elements were sawn into pieces, carried across the border to Tenosique, and then sold into private collections in Mexico, the United States, and Europe . Stela stubs and other ‘scarred remains’ from this looting period are visible at the site and the current location of many of the monuments documented by Maler are unknown . Drug Trafficking and Squatters The Mexico/Guatemala border in the Usumacinta region is both historically and currently volatile: it is an ‘area at the limits of state authority, where local and national governments struggle to maintain order and law’ . Armed drug traffickers use the national park as a midway point: a base to receive cocaine and other drugs from Colombia that will eventually end up in the United States . These traffickers are supported by illegal settlers, often referred to as squatters, who maintain remote airstrips and protect shipments. In 2005 archaeologist Stephen Houston reported that drug traffickers had ‘basically encamped at Piedras Negras itself’ . Sources within Guatemala stated that the traffickers were heavily armed and linked to Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel . Guillermo González, then head of Guatemala’s drug police, stated that the site is essentially only accessible by the river, making it difficult for police to approach, and that whenever authorities did near the site, the drug traffickers would flee across the border into Mexico . In a post to the Mesoamerican archaeology email list Aztlan, archaeologist Charles Golden emphasised that the situation at Piedras Negras was dire: ‘This could be the moment in which Piedras Negras is lost to the looters for good…the Usumacinta is now a free trade zone for looters, loggers, and narcos’ . In 2008, reports continued to emerge of at least six groups of squatters occupying Piedras Negras . Partial List of Looted Piedras Negras Monuments[1] Piedras Negras Stela 5, looted and now in the MET under agreement with the Guatemalan government Piedras Negras Stela 5 photographed by Mahler in situ, circa 1890s Piedras Negras Stela 1, located near the line of Stelae 2 through 7 but set below it, was recorded by Maler as broken into two large fragments. The stela depicts Lady K’atun, the wife of Piedras Negras Ruler 3 , and the back was better preserved than the front. In the 1960s, looters attempted to remove glyphs from the back of the stela and saw marks can be seen where columns J and K of the inscription once were . Piedras Negras Stela 2 was discovered by Maler in a row of stelae on a terrace in front of structure J-4. Maler described it as existing in three large fragments and the front of the sculpture, which depicts a standing ruler, was in otherwise good condition. In the 1960s the front face of Stela 2 was sawn away by looters . This face is now in 15 pieces. It is housed the Minneapolis Institute of Arts which acquired the stela around 1966 from the Stendahl Galleries [2]. Alan Shestack, a former director of the Institute, has admitted to being embarrassed by the presence of the stela fragment within the museum , particularly after it was listed in Coggins as being stolen. He states that it was ‘mutilated’ by looters and that it is ‘in wretched condition now, hardly enjoyable to look at’ . Piedras Negras Stela 3 was found by Maler broken into three fragments next to Stela 2. Although the front was in poor condition, the back retained an inscription which focused on Lady K’atun, Ruler 3, and their daughter ‘Precious Turtle’ who was depicted as seated on a throne . In the 1960s looters sawed the stela into smaller pieces, badly damaging the inscription. The looters attempted to extract the central figure but later abandoned it at the site, however they did cut the text away for later sale . Some fragments from this stela were purchased by the Brooklyn Museum and were mentioned in Coggins . These were bought from Robert Huber, a Milwaukee-based dealer, for $3000 . Due to the mounting legal issues involved in owning Mesoamerican monuments at the time, the museum voluntarily offered the fragments to Guatemala in 1970 . The fragments were formally handed over to the Guatemalan ambassador on 6 June 1972. Most of the fragments of Stela 3 are now stored in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City, however a very small portion of the back of the stela depicting a lidded vessel is said to be in a private collection in Mérida, Mexico . Piedras Negras Stela 4, discovered by Maler in the same stela line as Stelae 2 through 7, was initially found in three fragments. The front, which depicted a ruler holding two captives, was recorded as being well preserved. In the 1960s looters ‘trimmed’ the stela for easy transport and some of the sawn remains of the sculpture are now found in the plaza below the terrace that it once rested upon. A portion of the stela bearing the image of a captive is reportedly in an unnamed private collection . O’Neil , citing personal communication with Donald Hales, places the fragment in the collection of the Galerie Jeanne Bucher, Paris, at least at some point. A small fragment, a head from the figure’s belt, is in the Rufino Tamayo Museum in Oaxaca, Mexico . Piedras Negras Stela 5, discovered by Maler in the same stela line as Stelae 2 through 7, was intact when found. The front of the sculpture was described as being in pristine condition with the main portion of the work (about three fourths of the stela) depicting two individuals. This main portion was ‘thinned’ in the 1960s by looters to allow for easier transport, a process that destroyed the glyphs on the side of the stela. The bottom portion of the stela is still at Piedras Negras . The upper fragment was mentioned in as being in an American museum, and Bator places it as being in the collection of the Museum of Primitive Art, New York. When the Museum of Primitive Art collection was moved to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the MET arranged to keep the piece on long-term loan from the government of Guatemala as loan number L.1970.78 . Piedras Negras Stela 7, discovered by Maler in the same stela line as Stelae 2 through 6, was found broken into two pieces. The front, which depicted an ornately dressed standing lord, was described as being in pristine condition with the remains of paint found on the figure’s costume. In the 1960s the stela was sawn into pieces by looters. The top fragment, which was ‘trimmed’ off the stela so that the ruler’s headdress and face could be removed for sale, is now housed in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City . This piece had been displayed in Mexico’s national museum in 1969 as the ‘piece of the month’. When it was identified as having come from Piedra Negras, Mexico returned it . Piedras Negras Stela 8 was found by Maler near the line of Stelae 2 through 7. It was broken into 3 pieces and the front, which depicted a standing Ruler 3 and two kneeling figures, was described as being in pristine condition. In the 1960s, looters removed most of the upper half of the stela and the whereabouts of those pieces are unknown . Photos from the 1970s show that looters attempted to removed the carved body of the figure on the stela, accidentally cutting through its leg in an attempt to separate it from a carved captive . One of the two carved captives from this stela was found abandoned at the site and buried by archaeologists for its protection . Piedras Negras Stela 9 was found by Maler on a large terrace to the east of structure J-3. It depicted a standing lord and was found in three weathered fragments. During the 1960s, looters sawed off a captive figure that was located in the lower left of the front of the sculpture . In 2019, a portion of Stela 9 consisting of the standing lord’s owl headdress appeared at a Millon auction house sale held at the premises of Drouot in Paris . The piece had been consigned from the collection of Manichak and Jean Aurance who listed the provenance as being purchased from Pierre Langlois in Paris in 1965, who in turn had purchased it from California-based dealer Earl Stendahl in the “années 60”. The stela fragment was removed from the auction by agreement with the seller but as of the time of writing no decision has been made regarding the future of the piece. Piedras Negras Stela 10. A head ornament from the central figure’s belt was removed by looters . Its whereabouts are unknown. Piedras Negras Stela 11, originally located on a terrace in front of Structure 3, was discovered by Maler face-down and broken into two pieces. The sculpture was otherwise in good condition and it depicted a seated ruler surrounded by other scenes. In the 1960s, looters sawed the stela into smaller pieces and transported it out of Guatemala. The piece depicting a seated ruler is now in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston . According to Stuart and Graham , the lower portion of the stela was reportedly in private hands in Switzerland as of 1995. Piedras Negras Stela 25, originally located in the South Group. This stela was ‘trimmed’ below the figure’s chin and near the top of the headdress so that the face could be removed for transport and sale . The worn face on this stela was re-carved after it was looted, making the head smaller and adding new eyes, a new nose, and a new mouth . A fragment of this stela is housed at Guatemala’s Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología. The top of this stela, depicting the Principal Bird Deity, is in the Linden-Museum in Stuttgart . A fragment of this stela, it is unclear which, was in the Collection of Guy Loudmer and Hervé Poulin and was offered for sale at the Paris auction house Hôtel des Ventes in 1985 . Piedras Negras Stela 26, originally located in the South Group. A carved captive was sawn off of this stela by looters . O’Neil states that Ian Graham’s unpublished notes record that this fragment was once in Mexico City in the hands of a French collector. Piedras Negras Stela 29, originally located in the South Group. Two text fragments from this stela are said to be in Tokyo . Piedras Negras Stela 32, originally located in the South Group. Maler photographed this eroded stela during his work at the site . In 1968, Parke-Bernet Galleries advertised a stela for sale which was found to be the significantly re-carved Stela 32 . O’Neil records that it had been cut into pieces, the text removed, and the entire front had been re-carved, seemingly using imagery from another looted and re-carved stela from a different site (ibid.). Piedras Negras Stela 34, originally located in the South Group. The front of this stela was cut in to pieces by looters and reassembled for sale . The Galerie Jeanne Bucher (Paris), purchased this piece sometime before 1966 . Piedras Negras Stela 35, originally located in the South Group. A carved captive was sawn off this stela by looters based on a 2005 photograph . The top of this monument was also looted at some point and was in the Ludwig Collection then Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum für Völkerkunde in Köln, Germany ."
"93.txt","A Fremont Culture figurine stolen from the collection of a Utah museum and anonymously returned nearly four decades later. The so-called Fremont Culture lived in the Utah region from approximately 700 to 1300 AD. The culture, which was contemporaneous to the more famous Ancient Pueblo/Anasazi culture to the south, is defined by a number of similar material cultural traits including gray ware pottery and distinctive basketry and petroglyphs. Discovery of the Pilling Collection In March 1950 a rancher named Clarence Pilling (along with his brothers Art and Woodrow and ranch hands Dusty Pruitt and Tony Finn) discovered eleven clay figurines in a rock overhang while searching a side canyon of Range Creek, Utah for lost cattle . The figurines were found lying in a row, uncovered and visible in a slight recess four feet above ground level . Pilling brought the figurines to a family friend named Geneve Oliver who took them to Neil Judd at the Smithsonian and then to Noel Morss at Harvard’s Peabody Museum. The figurines are now commonly called ‘Pilling Figurines’ or the ‘Pilling Collection’ and the site they were found at is referred to as the ‘Pilling Site’ or ‘Pilling Cave’ (College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum ). The figurines were officially the property of the Pilling family but eventually became federal property and were placed under the care of the College of Eastern Utah’s Prehistoric Museum, where they remain . Description of the Pilling Figurines and site Noel Morss of the Peabody Museum inspected the figurines and then visited the site where he made some preliminary archaeological and geological observations . The figurines are between four and six inches long and are made of unbaked clay . They are decorated with applied clay ornaments and red, buff and black paint . Excluding the applied ornaments, the figurines were constructed all as one piece without the addition of temper . The backs of the figurines are undecorated (College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum ). Morss believed that the figurines were meant to be seen from the front and, because their applied decorations were so fragile, they could not have been carried around or attached to a person nor could they have been tied to anything in a vertical position . The figurines appear to be organized into six matched pairs of male and female ‘mates’ . The females have breasts and wider hips and wear aprons and the males wear breechclouts or kilt-like skirts, which may represent fringed leather . A twelfth figurine presumably did not survive to be found by Pilling, meaning that there is one more female figurine than male figurine (College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum ). Based on iconographic idiosyncrasies, Morss determined that the figurines were all made by the same artist, but were not necessarily made at the same time . However, he felt it was probable that each figure of a ‘couple’ were constructed together . The Pilling Site itself is an irregular area that is about 100 feet long and twelve feet wide at its broadest point (College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum ). The remains of an oval shaped room with a stone foundation and wooden superstructure were found at the site . A number of well-preserved timbers from this structure were still in situ when Morss visited in the early 1950s . The figurines were found associated with other objects and appear to have been deliberately placed below a poorly-preserved petroglyph of a stylized human figure . The petroglyph was rendered in white paint with an inverted trapezoidal head, broad shoulders, a flaring base, and without arms or legs . Display and disappearance The figurines have been on public display in various locations since shortly after they were found. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s the Pilling Collection was displayed in a number of banks, courthouses, and hotels in Utah. In 1973, the figurines were displayed at the Zions First National Back, Carbon-Emery Division, in Price, Utah . A photograph of this exhibition published in the Deseret Magazine showed all eleven figurines . In 1974 the figurines were on display in the College of Eastern Utah (now Utah State University Eastern) Prehistoric Museum, also in Price . Only ten of the figurines made it to that exhibition. One of those ten figurines had broken in half meaning that there still seemed to be eleven pieces in the collection. This may have caused some confusion and the loss of the eleventh figurine went unnoticed for some time .1 Morss designated the missing figurine, one of the males, as ‘No. 2’ . The figurine is decorated with a spotted line of red paint on the forehead and three horizontal lines of red paint under the eyes. It wears ear ornaments, a necklace of three tiers of pierced pendants, a discoid belt, and a fringed ‘kilt’ . An anonymous delivery In November 2011, a small box was delivered to the office of Bonnie Pitblado, an anthropologist at Utah State University. The box had been hand-delivered to Pitblado’s assistant by an anonymous person and contained what appeared to be a Fremont Culture figurine in the style of the Pilling Collection pieces along with a typed note . The note stated that: ‘Sometime between 1978 and 1982 I came into possession of this piece by way of a vagabond acquaintance. He had told of ‘acquiring’ it near Vernal, Utah. I have great interest and respect for this continent’s native culture and have always hoped to somehow return this to wherever it had come from. It has rarely been out of the soft leather covering I put around it and have kept it in the condition in which I received it. Recently in conversation I mentioned its existence to a friend and told of my desire to find its original home, they offered to help and were able to find that it may be the missing piece of the Pilling Figurine set. I am very excited at the prospect of it being returned to its proper place. Thanks to all who are involved in making this happen.’ . Pitblado has had no interaction with the person who returned the figurine. She believes that the person may wish to remain anonymous because of recent federal raids of Utah-based antiquities looters . Scientific analysis of the figurines A preliminary comparison of photographs of the complete Pilling Collection and the artifact delivered to Pitblado hinted at a possible match with the missing eleventh figurine . Fearing that the object might be a fake, Pitblado sought the expertise of multidisciplinary group of scholars to confirm the figurine belonged with the Pilling Collection. James Adovasio, a textile expert from Mercyhurst College, confirmed that the artist who made the figurines placed them on baskets to dry. After examining the female ‘mate’ of the missing figurine and the figurine delivered to Pitblado, he found the basket impression patterns to be the same, a feature that he believes could not have been faked . X-ray fluorescence confirmed that both the clay and the pigments found on the Pilling Collection pieces and the figurine sent to Pitblado share the same geochemical signature . In other words, the clay and pigment used to make all eleven figurines, including the one delivered to Pitblado, came from the same source. Furthermore, the signature of the returned figurine is more like that of the ‘mate’ of the missing figurine than any other figurine in the Pilling Collection . Steve Nelson, a geochemist at Brigham Young University, used a scanning electron microscope to confirm the presence of a lacquer called ‘alvar’ on the returned figurine . This is significant because it is known that in 1950 all eleven figurines were treated with this substance while they were being studied at the Peabody Museum . Molly Boeka Cannon of Utah State University’s geospatial anthropology lab (also called the Utah Crime Lab) ran forensic fingerprint tests on prints found embedded in the clay of the figurines . These prints are thought to be ancient. No definitive match was found between the prints embedded in the returned figurine and the remaining ten figurines from the Pilling collection as most of these prints had been purposely smoothed over by the artist who made the objects . Identity confirmed Based on the results of these scientific analyses, the returned figurine is considered to be the missing artefact from the Pilling Collection. It is now on display at the Utah State University Eastern Prehistoric Museum along with the other ten figurines in the Collection. The rock shelter on which the figurines were found has since collapsed but archaeologists have located other Fremont cultural features near the Pilling Site (College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum ). The circumstances of the theft of the eleventh Pilling Figurine and the identity of the person who returned it remain unclear. This case study is a good example of the fractured chains of provenance cultural objects can have in the market, disappearing and resurfacing with no verifiable information about all or part of their periods off the public record, the ease with which knowledge of an object’s true importance can be wiped out by a loss or theft, and the subsequent lack of knowledge on the part of private buyers as to what it is they are actually buying."
"94.txt","A large Maya temple decoration that was located in 1968, a rare example of photographic documentation of the looting process. See photographs of the looting of Placeres in our Data Section. In or around 1968 a massive, well-preserved stucco temple facade was located by treasure hunters operating in the jungle regions of Campeche, Mexico . The massive sculptural piece is decorated with the head of either an unknown Maya lord or the maize god (Museo Nacional de Antropolgía ) wearing an elaborate masked headdress. On each side of the lord are heads and upper bodies of elderly Maya gods holding glyphs. The god to the left holds the glyphs for ‘black’ and ‘yellow’ and the god on the right holds the glyph for ‘reed’ and an image of a jaguar (Museo Nacional de Antropolgía ). According to the finders, the facade had been found at the little-known site of Placeres and had appeared to have been intentionally buried by the ancient Maya . Placeres, which was first recorded by Sylvanus G. Morely in the 1930s, is a Late Classic Maya site located in the jungle of the Mexican state of Campeche about 35 miles east of the major Maya city of Calakmul near a former chicle station of the same name. The treasure hunters allegedly notified their contact, the late Everett Rassiga, an antiquities dealer, of the discovery . Based on several interviews, Karl H. Meyer records that ‘Henry Beta’ (a pseudonym; identified here as Rassiga) obtained photographs of the façade in situ and offered them first to Mexico-based collector Josué Sáenz, who is linked to the trafficking of the Grolier Codex . Sáenz turned down the piece but Rassiga felt he could find a buyer in the US so he ordered the piece be looted. In an operation that Meyer reports as costing more than $80,000, an airstrip was cleared and a plane was flown in from Florida . The facade was covered in moulds (see photographs) and sawed into transportable pieces. Meyer states that the saws struck stone pegs within the stucco which shattered portions of the piece. The facade was then flown to Mérida, was placed in crates that had been mislabeled, and was shipped to New Orleans and then on to New York City . According to an account published by archaeologist David Freidel, once the facade was in the USA, Rassiga approached Thomas Hoving, then director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York[1], about having the piece displayed in an upcoming exhibition entitled ‘Before Cortés’. The piece also allegedly offered to the Met for sale, with an asking price of $400,000 . After reviewing the piece with museum vice director of operations Joseph Veach Noble, Hoving decided to notify Dr Ignacio Bernal at Mexico’s National Museum of Anthropology of the possible major theft from a Maya site . According to Meyer’s account, Bernal visited the Met and determined that the façade was Mexican cultural property. When he asked who was selling the piece, Hoving informed him verbally that it was against Met policy to name the names of dealer, but then motioned with his chin to a slip of paper in his breast pocket that bore Rassiga’s name . Noble then called Rassiga back in to the Met, presented Bernal, and informed the dealer that they would not be displaying the façade and that they felt it should be returned to Mexico. At this point Rassiga allegedly suggested to the shocked Bernal that he felt that someone should pay for the $80,000 he spent getting the piece to the US [2]. Bernal notified Mexican authorities who determined that Rassiga owned a house in the Mexican city of Cuernavaca, Morales. They allegedly contacted Rassiga and informed him that his home would be seized if he did not promptly return the facade . Rassiga subsequently returned the facade to Mexico. It is now on display in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City (Museo Nacional de Antropolgía ). The facade having been returned, legal proceedings were not pursued, however the Mexican government asserts that the export of the facade was illegal under Mexican law (Museo Nacional de Antropolgía ). The looted stucco facade from the site of Placeres, Mexico (from the website of the Museo Nacional de Antropología, Mexico City) In the mid-1980s, archaeologist David Freidel obtained a series of photographs reportedly taken by the man ‘who had been sent to oversee the clearing, cutting, and shipping of the facade to New York’ . The forty-seven photographs, reproduced on our Data section with the permission of both the original photographer and David Freidel, provide helicopter- or small plane-based views of the site of Placeres and the building that the facade was found within. They show all of the known iconographic elements of the facade in situ protected by a blue tarp, as well as some elements that were either not moved or destroyed during the removal process. The facade is pictured being covered in plaster for its protection and then sawn into several large pieces for removal and transport. Finally, the central mask is pictured lying on a surface, both with the stucco protective layer and with the stucco removed."
"95.txt","Once a strategically significant port and fort located close to Kingston in Jamaica, Port Royal was largely submerged following an earthquake, which left its underwater remains vulnerable to treasure hunting and commercial salvage. The site of Port Royal started initially as a sand spit, which the Tainos (the first inhabitants of Jamaica) used as a fishing camp, and was later used by Spanish ‘for cleaning, refitting and caulking of their sailing vessels’ . When a British invasion of Jamaica took place under the commands of Admiral Penn and General Venables in May 1655, a fort, initially known as Passage Fort or Fort Cromwell (after the Lord Protector of England, Oliver Cromwell) was constructed soon after . Alongside the fort, a town named The Point or Point Cagway was established, and following the restoration of Charles II in England, the fort was renamed Fort Charles, and the settlement Port Royal . The settlement, which by 1692 had developed to become ‘arguably the largest and most affluent English town in the New World’ , was also notorious for piracy and buccaneering . On 7 June 1692, a cataclysmic earthquake struck, which along with a subsequent tidal wave killed around 2,000 people . Over the following days, a further 3,000 perished from injuries and disease . Structurally, the effects of the natural disaster were also profound for Port Royal, as the earthquake ‘caused about 60% of the town to literally slide into the sea’ . Attempts were made to rebuild sections of Port Royal, although it was destroyed when a fire swept through in 1703. Finally in 1722 a storm, a hurricane, and more earthquakes meant that ‘Port Royal as it once was disappeared for the last time’ . However, the site was still used after this period for other purposes, for example as a British Naval Dockyard until 1905, and in the present survives as a ‘quiet fishing village’, albeit one with significant sites of historic and touristic interest . Port Royal has been described as a ‘catastrophic’ archaeological site; one of relatively very few (including Pompeii and Herculaneum) to have been created rapidly in the aftermath of a natural or other kind of disaster: ‘time is frozen, revealing a complete picture of life in the past as it once was’ . Looting and Thefts Northern part of Port Royal, Jamaica, 1806 Almost immediately after the first earthquake in the sixteenth century, looters began targeting the submerged sections , many of whom were ‘wrackers’ (professional treasure hunters) from Bermuda . Much of this ‘salvage and looting continued intermittently for years’ . Robert Marx, who himself explored the underwater site and recovered numerous artefacts in the 1960s, also alleges that a major theft at the Port Royal Museum in 1971, in which many artefacts including some recovered by Marx and his team went missing, was not made public at the time and no prosecutions were made . Excavations and treasure hunting In 1859, the Falmouth Post ran an article by a British diver from the Royal Navy named Jeremiah D. Murphy, who had discovered sections of a fort underwater . Throughout the 20th Century, explorations of the site intermittently took place, and there were also warnings of the risk to underwater sites from ‘professional and amateur divers in search of the ubiquitous sunken galleons loaded with treasure, creating serious problems for the future of marine archaeology’ . Explorations of Port Royal ranged from the alleged removal in 1954 of artefacts, including a doorway and stairs by an American couple named Mr and Mrs Alexi Dupont , through to the work of ‘noted inventor and treasure hunter Edwin Link… …at the invitation of the wife of the American Consul General in Jamaica’ in 1956 . In the 1960s, Norman Scott and then Robert Marx were employed by the Jamaican government to examine Port Royal, at a time that ‘underwater archaeology worldwide was still in its infancy’ . During this time, it was reportedly common to find artefacts from the submerged city, with local residents apparently regularly selling ‘interesting artifacts’ to tourists . From the 1970s onwards, ‘it became the consistent policy of the Jamaica National Heritage Trust (JNHT) to only give permission for archaeological research… …to qualified archaeologists’ . In 1968, British archaeologist Philip Mayes was employed by the Jamaican National Trust Commission, with supporting funding from the British Ministry of Overseas Development, to carry out further excavation, including on land . When Mayes left in 1971, work was continued by Richard Priddy, another British archaeologist . However, the longest period of excavation at Port Royal took place from 1981 to 1990 under Donny Hamilton, an American archaeologist who carried out the work in conjunction with the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, Texas A&M University and the Jamaican National Heritage Trust . He returned in 1992 for a further dive . Researchers from Texas A&M University continued to be based at Port Royal in 2012, carrying out archival research . Measures to protect Port Royal and other underwater cultural heritage in Jamaica In 1990, ‘faced with an increase in illegal poaching and applications for treasure-hunting activities’, the Jamaican government took the decision to adopt a policy of allowing ‘only professional archaeological excavations in the territorial waters of Jamaica’ . However, apparently influenced by ‘presumed renewed interest worldwide in treasure hunting and advances in technology to access underwater cultural heritage sites’, the policy was amended in 2000 to allow ‘commercial exploitation of the underwater cultural heritage within certain guidelines’ . This policy posed challenges to heritage professionals working in Jamaica, who were faced with ‘ethically and professionally’ opposing looting and ‘nonscientific recovery of material from archaeological sites’, while also trying to adhere to the government policy of licensing commercial salvage . Commercial treasure hunting has been suggested elsewhere as ‘the greatest threat’ to underwater cultural heritage: ‘Treasure hunters entice governments with promises of sure profits, but the overall result has been destruction of LAC [Latin America and Caribbean] heritage sites and no sign of financial reward for participating countries.’ Jamaica was involved in discussions and meetings of UNESCO to draft the 2001 Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, but it was not able to ratify the convention, despite supporting it, until its own legislation had been sufficiently amended with regard to its policy towards commercial salvage . The vulnerability of the site to commercial exploitation, and the recognition that the site and associated artefacts should be preserved in situ ‘unless there is valid scientific or public reason to recover’ was recognised at the Caribbean Meeting on the Protection of Underwater Cultural Heritage at Morgan’s Harbour Hotel in Port Royal in May 2011 . The meeting, which included representatives of the Jamaican government, resulted in UNESCO recommending that the Jamaican government take measures to protect the remains of Port Royal . On 9 August 2011, Jamaica deposited with the Director-General of UNESCO its instrument of ratification of the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage . In 2012, the site was identified as a potential World Heritage Site , something which has been suggested intermittently in previous years as well . There are discussions to develop facilities for both tourists and local people to enjoy and learn more about the site, including the suggestion of a museum and an archaeological park . However, the safeguarding of the remaining archaeological material continues to be central to any plans for tourism development with the government accepting ‘responsibility for seeing that the archaeological damage is mitigated as much as possible’, including involving an experienced archaeologist in any planning from the outset ."
"96.txt","Remote Classic Maya site which was extensively looted in the 1970s for spectacular grave goods. The Classic Maya site of Río Azul, located in the deep jungle of the northeastern corner of Guatemala, was officially discovered in 1962 by Trinidad Pech, an employee of Sun Oil Company[1], although it may have been known to locals for some time . Archaeologist Richard ’ trenches and was “nearly intact” . Because the site was so remote, archaeologists were unable to excavate there at that time . Reports from residents of nearby villages indicate that in 1976 a wealthy and unnamed Guatemalan collector targeted Río Azul in a major looting operation . He employed small groups of workers who searched for tombs at the site for two years. In 1978 the collector increased the size of the work gangs, eventually employing up to eighty workers. These gangs organised under the leadership of a local Guatemalan man (a different person than the unnamed collector) who may have had an indirect relationship with an unnamed archaeologist from the United States who was working at Tikal at the time . Several of the looters had previously worked as labourers on legitimate archaeological excavations in the region. Some reports indicate that small planes regularly landed on an old Sun Oil Company airstrip twenty-five miles from the site to haul away looted artefacts. The amount of material coming from Río Azul was such that Adams believes that it became a standard provenance catch-all for Maya material: items from other Maya sites were said to come from Río Azul when they hit the art market . Adams has alleged that the looters and collectors got expert advice ‘from a corrupt archaeologist from an eastern [] university’ , but did not reveal who that was. In 1981, archaeologist Ian Graham heard a rumour that a number of rich tombs had been located by looters at Río Azul and decided to check out the situation . Upon reaching the site, Graham and then Director of Prehispanic Monuments Rafael Morales caught the looters in the act. Guatemalan government treasury agents exchanged gunfire with the looters who eventually fled into the jungle . Graham and Morales took photographs of the empty tombs, several of which bore elaborately painted hieroglyphic inscriptions in red and white, the likes of which had never been seen before . It wasn’t until 1983 that Graham and Adams were able to raise the money needed to fund a project to record what was left of these tombs . The project found twenty-eight looted tombs and more than 125 open looters’ trenches and tunnels at Río Azul. ‘The dozens of artefacts looted from at least twenty-eight tombs at Río Azul represent a great loss to the cultural patrimony of Guatemala and humanity in general, as well as a considerable setback in the efforts to reconstruct a picture of Classic Maya civilization’ ."
"97.txt","A Classic Maya funerary mask apparently looted from the Guatemalan site of Río Azul and illicitly trafficked into the United tates and then Europe. The most famous apparently-looted object from the site of Río Azul is a mask made of fuschite[1] depicting Kinich Ahaw, the sun god. The mask seems to have been the death mask of a lord, and text on the back of the object confirms that it belonged to a Río Azul ruler . Adams speculates that the mask may have come from Tomb 1, as inscriptions in that tomb claim the sun god as an ancestor. If this is true, inscriptions in the tomb would date the mask to the Early Classic Period . At least two other jade objects from Río Azul have appeared in a private collection in Brussels: matching earflares that bear the Río Azul emblem glyph . There is some speculation that these relate to the jade mask and may have come from the same body. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the mask came into the possession of a businessman named Peter G. Wray from Scottsdale, Arizona . Wray offered the mask and other items in his collection for sale through Andre Emmerich’s New York Gallery in 1984. According to Adams , archaeologist Ian Graham saw the mask for sale in the gallery, noting the Río Azul emblem glyph on its back. The mask failed to sell for the asking price of $470,000 during an April 1984 exhibition, although a Río Azul tripod vase also from the Wray Collection was sold to the Detroit Institute of Art at that time . At some point later the mask was reportedly sold for $35,000, and was moved to an unknown location . Around this time National Geographic Magazine and the Guatemalan Institute of Anthropology and History offered $10,000 ‘for a photograph that shows the object in the undisturbed location in which it was found’ . While there was no proof that such a photograph existed, the call was meant to produce evidence that would conclusively prove that the mask came from Guatemala and thus was the property of that country. No photograph was forthcoming. During the 1990s the mask was rumoured to be in a private collection in Germany, having passed through Switzerland . In late 1999 the piece surfaced in a temporary exhibition in the Barbier-Mueller Pre-Columbian Art Museum in Barcelona where it was seen by several Guatemalan government officials . In July 2001, the government of Guatemala issued a legal claim for the Río Azul mask as well as 11 other Guatemalan items in the Barbier-Mueller collection . This process, documented extensively in Hernández Sánchez , came to an end in 2002 when a Barcelona court denied Guatemala’s claim, stating that any alleged crime would have occurred outside of Spain’s jurisdiction . The mask is thought to still be in the Barbier-Mueller collection, having been moved back to Switzerland, but its exact whereabouts remain unknown . Was the mask looted? How can we know? The mask is thought to come from this looted tomb (from National Geographic) The mask from Río Azul is a good example of how we might apply the principle of Occam’s Razor to hypothetical provenance and provenience claims in illicit antiquities cases. In other words, the most plausible scenario is the one which demands the fewest assumptions based on the available evidence. One might naturally ask the question ‘do we know this mask was looted from the site of Río Azul in the late 1970s and illegally smuggled into the United States shortly after that time?’ The answer is that we do not know, but the available evidence strongly points towards this as the most likely explanation of the recent history of the mask. The argument for looting, based on the evidence, would proceed roughly as follows: The Maya were a literate culture; an inscription on the back of the mask bears the emblem glyph of Río Azul[2] and the name of a ruler sometimes rendered as Zak Balam or Sak Balam (White Jaguar), also called Ruler X or Governor X . Due to the complex nature of the language, a grammatically and contextually correct Maya inscription is nearly impossible to fake; the mask is not considered to be a forgery. Zak Balam’s name and image appear on Stela 1 at Río Azul, a monument that is still at the site, confirming he was a ruler of that polity. The date on that Stela is 26 March 393 AD. The looted Tomb 1 in structure C-1 at Río Azul was an elite tomb. The date 9 September 417 AD is painted on the wall of the tomb in a context that would closely align with the symbolic birth of the individual interred there into the next world, in other words his death . Both the dates and matching water/swamp mythology iconography, would allow for the individual mentioned on the mask and Stela 1 to have been buried in Tomb 1. Maya masks are typically found in funerary contexts associated with the individual that they depict or name (the mask of Pakal of Palenque for example). Tomb 1 had not been looted in 1962 when the site was visited by Richard Tomb 1 had been looted in 1981 when Ian Graham visited the site . Guatemala claimed ownership of all archaeological remains, even undiscovered remains in 1947 via Article 1 of Decreto No 425. The mask was not seen on the art market or in a private or public collection until the early 1980s . On the basis of this progression of analysis, a reasonable person might conclude that the mask was looted from Tomb 1 at Río Azul sometime between 1962 and 1981 , was illegally smuggled out of Guatemala and trafficked into the United States. In most jurisdictions where repatriation claims are litigated, a dispossessed country must prove that an artefact came from a specific archaeological site after a specific date (usually the date that the country in question claimed ownership over archaeological objects). This is, essentially, how the claimant state proves its ownership of the piece and thus that the piece had been stolen. If clear proof of these stipulations is not forthcoming, it is common for courts to rule in favour of the current possessor of the object (a good example of this is Peru v. Johnson). It is not unusual for current possessors of cultural objects to raise the possibility of hypothetical situations to explain how the object may have legitimately come to them, which test the bounds of plausibility to their limits. Some of the arguments in the case of the Weary Herakles fall into this category for some , the burden of proof in these disputes is high and on the claimant."
"98.txt","A Classic Maya vase now in the Detroit Institute of Arts that is thought, based on linguistic evidence, to have been looted from Tomb 12 at the Guatemalan site of Río Azul in the late 1970s. Based on linguistic and stylistic evidence, this cylindrical blackware Maya vessel is thought to have been looted from the site of Río Azul in Guatemala. It rests on three slab feet and has a matching lid. The lid is topped with a ceramic tube. Both the lid and the body of the vase are decorated in a swirled pattern, partially carved with geometric designs, partially stuccoed and painted in white, red, and Maya blue. The painted portion contains a series of flowers, and in the centre of each is a glyph. The vase is thought to come from Tomb 12 at Río Azul as both the vase and the tomb bear inscriptions mentioning a person named Six Sky . This tomb is thought to have been opened by looters in the late 1970s as the building it was located in was recorded as intact by archaeologists before that time. The vase also bears the emblem glyph of Río Azul which very strongly links the vessel with that site . The vase was reportedly offered for sale, along with a fuschite mask, by the Andre Emmerich Gallery in New York . It appeared alongside other artefacts in the possession of Scottsdale, Arizona businessman Peter G. Wray and was purchased by the Detroit Institute of Arts in April 1984 for an undisclosed sum thought to have been between $10,000 and $30,000 . The piece remains in the Detroit Institute of Arts and is recorded as being a ‘Founders Society Purchase, Arthur H. Nixon Fund’ (Detroit Institute of Art ). When asked by the Philadelphia Inquirer about the possible looted nature of this vase and others purchased from Andre Emmerich Gallery, Sam Sachs, the director of the Institute from 1985 until 1997, issued the following statement: We do not know from what site these vases come. Had we thought they came from a looted site, we never would have acquired them. The [institute] bought them in good faith and on the firm representation of the owner to hold us harmless and that the piece was legally imported into the … It is our policy and the policy of UNESCO and the , illegally exported or imported objects. When then-curator of African, Oceanic and New World Art Michael Kan was asked if the museum required any export permit documentation proving the item was legal before purchasing the piece he responded, ‘Oh, heavens no Who has time to do that? We’re very busy people here. I don’t know what that’s like. It’s like asking people if they check out every vitamin that’s in a capsule’ ."
"99.txt","When a London antiquities dealer offered the British Museum rare Iron Age bronze miniature shields, it triggered the tracing of the origins of a unique and archaeologically significant, but illegally looted, hoard. In the summer of 1988, following correspondence concerning a collection that had recently come onto the market, Lord Alistair McAlpine, who at the time was an antiquities dealer based in London and also a Conservative member of the House of Lords, showed Dr Ian Stead from the British Museum twenty-two miniature bronze shields . At first, the provenience of these objects was unknown to the British Museum staff . However, despite this lack of provenience, the British Museum decided to purchase the artefacts anyway due to their rarity and significance . After some negotiation, McAlpine sold the shields to the British Museum for £55,000 . Different suggestions had been made about the possible county of origin for the artefacts, including Dorset and Gloucestershire . Not long after the acquisition, rumours also began circulating that a discovery had been made of 1,500 bronze objects, including miniature shields . Over the next few years, Stead and others tried to find out more about the mystery hoard (or hoards, as they could be; it was still unclear at this stage whether more than one hoard had been found due to the numbers of finds being discussed), then in December 1992 a breakthrough occurred. David Keys, a journalist with The Independent who had also been following the case, received a telephone call from one of the finders . Through further negotiations, the finder, who called himself ‘John of Salisbury’, was persuaded to meet Ian Stead at the Red Lion hotel in Salisbury, Wiltshire . Elaborating on details he had revealed to Keys, ‘John’ showed Stead photographs of the finds, one of which was later located in McAlpine’s catalogue . ‘John’ wished to sell the remainder of the artefacts that were still in his possession (some of which he had brought to the meeting in the Red Lion), including a razor, several socketed axes and two miniature cauldrons, to the British Museum for £20,000 . ‘John’ would not reveal his true identity to Stead. However, over the course of investigations, which by this time involved Detective Chief Inspector Jack Woods of Holborn police in London, who had a particular interest in and knowledge about archaeology and antiquities , it was established that ‘John of Salisbury’ was in fact James Garriock , a metal detecting enthusiast from Salisbury. On 22 October 1993, Stead again arranged to meet Garriock (‘John’), along with Stuart Needham, also from the British Museum, once more at the Red Lion. Garriock thought he was meeting to negotiate a possible sale to the Museum of the Salisbury artefacts in his possession; he had by now lowered his asking price from £20,000 to £10,000 . However, the meeting was in fact set up to facilitate his arrest for handling stolen goods . Later that day, Garriock’s associate and fellow metal detecting enthusiast, Terry Rossiter, was also arrested at his home in Salisbury . Rossiter led Stead, Needham, and the police officers into the field and showed them the find spots. It was also established that the landowners, on the outskirts of Salisbury, had not given permission for their land to be searched. Nor were they aware of the discovery that had been made . The investigation and subsequent trials revealed that the Salisbury Hoard had been found on 23 February 1985 . The finders, Garriock and Rossiter, had the artefacts photographed by another metal-detector user, apparently for the photographs to form a memento of the discovery . Garriock contacted John Cummings, an antiquities dealer from Lincolnshire, not long after this, and Cummings paid £10,500 for the majority of the collection . Some artefacts were kept back by the two finders , and a small selection were given to the photographer, which he subsequently sold . The artefacts circulated among different dealers and collectors, for example through informal networks at coin fairs and other dealer events . Some of these apparently passed to McAlpine , while other potential Salisbury Hoard artefacts surfaced at auction houses such as Christie’s in 1990, and were exported to Salt Lake City, USA . Others entered the collections of museums such as Devizes Museum in Wiltshire, who purchased their artefacts from a London antiquities dealer . A further fourteen items were listed for sale in the catalogue for Christie’s (South Kensington) Antiquities and Souvenirs of the Grand Tour sale of 27 October 1993. Lot 12 comprised eleven ‘bronze items’ with the provenance described as, ‘said to have been found in a well in Gloucestershire’ , and with publication in an Ashmolean Museum Exhibition catalogue of some of the collection of Lord McAlpine . Lot 15 comprised ‘two silvered bronze socketed axe heads… …and another similar’, with no provenance listed. Pre-sale estimates for the two lots were £150-250 and £200-300 respectively . These objects had been put into auction by McAlpine, but following discussions with Stead about the importance of keeping the objects together he subsequently had them withdrawn from sale . Garriock and Rossiter were tried in 1995, as was Cummings, who was tried for dishonestly receiving stolen artefacts . Garriock and Rossiter both pled guilty to theft , while charges against Cummings were dropped . Subsequent archaeological fieldwork led by Stead confirmed the location of the hoard’s discovery, and shed light on the nature and size of the Salisbury Hoard. For one thing, the initial rumours of 1,500 or so artefacts were shown to be an exaggeration, with the actual hoard size closer to 600 artefacts . The artefacts, from both the Bronze and Iron Ages, were buried around 200 BC , by which time some of them would already have been antiquities in their own right. This sheds important light on the understanding of society in the British Iron Age and ‘the notion of time and the idea of antiquity’ as understood by that society . Around a third of the total artefacts from the Salisbury Hoard remain unaccounted for , having been sold on without trace. Although Lord McAlpine was able to show he had no awareness that the artefacts he had sold to the British Museum had been stolen , he later closed his antiquities business in light of his experiences with the Salisbury Hoard . The Art Newspaper criticised the British Museum for initially purchasing the miniature shields, given their unknown origins , and one of the British Museum trustees even went on record as saying that ‘the Museum may have been wrong to purchase them for so large a sum in the first place’ . The landowner passed away in 1994 and the British Museum later returned the artefacts to his daughter , subsequently buying them back from her. They were unsuccessful in obtaining any financial recompense from McAlpine . Hence, the British Museum in effect bought and paid for the same collection of artefacts twice over, ‘at the expense of the public purse’ . The case of the Salisbury Hoard is particularly significant due to the efforts made by British Museum staff and others to follow up and establish precisely where the hoard had come from and what stages had been involved in its transition from the ground to the antiquities market. This is particularly the case for Stead, who was at the time in charge of Iron Age antiquities in the Department of Prehistoric and Romano-British Antiquities . Stead’s notes of the whole experience were written up into a comprehensive book covering the various stages involved, from when the first artefacts were offered for sale to the British Museum through the arrests and trials to the eventual excavations and analysis of the artefacts . Of particular note is the chart he developed, illustrating the routes of distribution of some of the Salisbury Hoard artefacts .
